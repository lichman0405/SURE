//! `sure check`, `sure recheck` and `sure repair`: one run of the check
//! pipeline, and the two ways of writing it down.
//!
//! # What this module is, and what it is not
//!
//! The three commands that reach the engine, and the only place in this crate
//! that does. It gathers what a run needs — the project, the project's settings,
//! the history, and the goal the user typed — hands them to
//! [`sure_core::pipeline::Pipeline`], and renders what comes back. **It runs no
//! stage itself**: no detector is called here, no result is aggregated here and
//! no verdict is assembled here. That is what makes "the CLI does not have a
//! second path into the engine" a fact about the source rather than a promise
//! about its behaviour, and it is why the three commands are one module: they
//! differ in how far down the twelve stages they go and in nothing else, so a
//! second copy of the gathering would be a second place for it to be wrong.
//!
//! # The goal, and why it is written first
//!
//! P2-T010's acceptance is that `sure check` can receive and store a trusted
//! explicit goal **without requiring raw transcript recording**. So a goal typed
//! on the command line is written to the record store as a requirement whose
//! source is [`IntentSource::ExplicitUserGoal`] — the source
//! [`IntentSource::is_user_requirement`] accepts, and one that
//! [`IntentSource::requires_full_recording`] asks nothing of. No opt-in is
//! consulted and no recording is written, because there is no session to capture:
//! the words were handed to SURE in the same breath as the command that stored
//! them.
//!
//! It is written **before** the check, which is the property
//! `docs/architecture/CLI.md` documents, and it feeds stage 2 of the same run:
//! the pipeline resolves intent from the goal it was handed rather than from
//! what it happens to find in the history, so a run cannot record one thing and
//! check against another.
//!
//! # What the report shows, and what the record holds
//!
//! One text. The store redacts every document it accepts, so the text beside
//! "Your goal was written to the history as record N" is not the words as they
//! arrived but the record's own text, read back out of that record — and it is
//! the text stage 2 resolves, so the requirement the run checks against is the
//! one it wrote down. The decision, the argument for it and the case against it
//! are in `docs/architecture/PROJECT_INTENT.md`; what is here is the half a
//! reader of this module needs: the goal is not exempt from the store's
//! redaction, and no surface of this command prints a text the record does not
//! hold.
//!
//! Every step before the write can refuse without having changed anything, which
//! is why the order is: the words, then the project path, then the fingerprint,
//! then the store, then the row. A goal with no words in it is refused before
//! SURE looks for its store, and a project SURE cannot read is refused before it
//! opens one — opening a store creates its directory and its file, and leaving a
//! database behind for a run that stored nothing would be a side effect of a
//! failure.
//!
//! # What a run writes on a machine that has never used SURE
//!
//! **Nothing.** The history is opened only when its file is already there: a
//! bare `sure check` on a machine with no history does not create one, because a
//! command that created a store in order to report what it had recorded would be
//! changing the thing it is describing. A run with no history is not a run with
//! a gap in the project — it is a run that has nothing to compare claims or
//! earlier findings against, and the pipeline records both stages as scope
//! limits with that reason.
//!
//! The one exception is `--goal`, which exists to write. A machine with history
//! has its store opened and read on every check, which is the ordinary cost of
//! comparing against what was recorded before.
//!
//! # Why a failure is status 5 and not 3
//!
//! 3 is "this build cannot carry that out", whose remedy is a newer build. These
//! commands *can* carry out what they were asked. A run that met an unreadable
//! project, settings it could not use or a history it could not open tried and
//! did not finish, which is what 5 is for. One status for both is how a broken
//! installation gets read as a build that has nothing to do.

    // preference and the user's own permissions both allow it, which is what the
    // refusals in the report are about when one of the three is missing.
