//! The command surface, as a grammar.
//!
//! `docs/architecture/CLI.md` is the authority for what these commands mean and
//! which phase implements each one. This module is only the shape: what SURE
//! accepts, and what it refuses before a command body is ever reached.
//!
//! # Why the grammar is one type
//!
//! [`Command`] is the whole surface in one enum, and
//! [`Command::report`](crate::commands::Command::report) matches on it
//! exhaustively. Adding a command to the grammar therefore cannot leave the
//! build compiling with no answer about whether this build implements it: the
//! match stops compiling until the new arm says.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not here
//!
//! No command carries a flag that only a later phase can honour. A grammar that
//! accepts `--deep` and does nothing with it is the CLI teaching a user that
//! SURE understood them when it did not, and the user has no way to tell.
//! Arguments arrive with the phase that can act on them.
