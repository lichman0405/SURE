//! `sure history`: what SURE has recorded on this machine, and how to be rid of
//! it.
//!
//! # What the user sees, and what they can do about it
//!
//! `docs/security/PRIVACY.md` asks for one thing of this command: "Users must be
//! able to inspect and delete local SURE history/recordings." The inspect half
//! is [`HistoryAction::List`] and [`HistoryAction::Show`]; the delete half is
//! [`HistoryAction::Delete`]. Both read and write the same rows, through
//! `sure_core::session_event_store`, and neither has a path of its own into
//! SQLite: the CLI owns the words, and the core owns what a session and an event
//! are.
//!
//! # Why the listing says what it does not know
//!
//! A session row carries `retention_days` and `retained_until_ms`, and **nothing
//! acts on them**: there is no pruning job in this build, and no caller of
//! `sessions_past_retention`, `events_past_retention`,
//! `full_recordings_past_retention` or `Store::delete_recordings` outside their
//! own tests. A listing that printed a deadline and stopped would leave a user
//! believing that a date in the past means the data is gone. It is not, and this
//! module says so in the output rather than in a document the user has not read.
//! Saying it there is also what keeps the sentence honest the day a pruning job
//! lands: it is one sentence, about this build, in one place.
//!
//! # Why a delete does not prompt
//!
//! `docs/architecture/CLI.md` left this decision to the command that needed it.
//! The answer is that **the scope on the command line is the consent**: exactly
//! one of `--all`, `--session ID` and `--project ROOT` is required, clap refuses
//! a command line with none or with two, and nothing is ever read from standard
//! input. A prompt is unusable from the harness integrations, which run SURE as a
//! subprocess; and a delete with no stated scope is worse, because the user
//! cannot see what it will do before it does it. Requiring the scope makes the
//! command line a description of the deletion, so it can be read in a script, in
//! a shell history, and in a bug report.
//!
//! # Why a failed delete cannot leave half a session
//!
//! The three tables are written in one transaction by
//! `SessionEventStore::delete_sessions`, which rolls back on any error. This
//! module never deletes row by row, and it never reports a count it did not get
//! back from the store: a delete whose scope matched nothing says so, in those
//! words, and a delete that failed is a [`Report::Failed`] with status 5.
//!
//! # Why nothing here is a claim about a project
//!
//! A history report says what is in the local store and what was removed from
//! it. It is not a verdict, it is not evidence about a project, and it changes no
//! verdict: `docs/architecture/CLI.md`'s "1 and 3 are never merged" is about
//! projects, and this command answers neither.
