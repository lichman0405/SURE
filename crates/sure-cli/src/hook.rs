//! `sure hook ingest`, and what it does in this build.
//!
//! # Why this is a module rather than an arm of `commands.rs`
//!
//! The same reason `crate::check` is one: [`Command::report`] is a match from a
//! command to a value, and the looking happens here so the match stays readable.
//!
//! # What the hook does
//!
//! 1. Read the raw JSON event from stdin.
//! 2. Normalise it with the harness-specific normaliser.
//! 3. Validate it via the existing ingestion path.
//! 4. Persist it via the existing session event store.
//! 5. For `pre-tool-use` events, evaluate a protection decision using the
//!    existing execution-safety machinery and return it as a structured JSON
//!    response — spending a one-time allowance the user recorded for exactly
//!    this request, if there is one, and answering with what SURE would then do
//!    (see [`with_any_allowance`]).
//! 6. Write that decision down beside the event it was about, so that it is
//!    still there after this process exits (see [`record_the_decision`]):
//!    `sure history` shows it and `sure history delete` removes it with the
//!    session it belongs to.
//!
//! `sure hook allow-once` is the other half of step 5: it is the command a
//! person runs to give the answer a hook cannot ask for, and it writes one row
//! to SURE's store. A hook is a fresh process per event, so that row is the only
//! place a one-time grant can live; see `sure_core::allowance`.
//!
//! # A project root SURE cannot use, and what SURE decided about it
//!
//! The event names the project it is about, and every question below the naming
//! reads that name as one location: the settings question asks whether the file
//! that decides what SURE may record and run is inside it
//! ([`Paths::ensure_settings_outside`]), and the store keys the session, the
//! event and the fingerprint by it ([`Paths::ensure_outside`]). A `project_root`
//! that is not an absolute path answers neither: it means "wherever this process
//! happens to be", and for a hook that is wherever the harness started SURE.
//!
//! **The decision (P15-T035): SURE refuses the event** — exit 5, no `decision`
//! field, nothing recorded — on every platform, before the settings file is read
//! and before anything is written. The refusal's own words are
//! [`sure_core::paths::PathError`]'s.
//!
//! The two answers not taken are worse, and both were argued rather than
//! dismissed. *Resolving* the path against the current directory would put a
//! location in the evidence that SURE inferred rather than read, and would make
//! which project an event is recorded under depend on where the harness started
//! the process; `crate::check`'s `project_of` refuses to do exactly that to a
//! path a **person** typed ("SURE does not silently repair an argument"), and an
//! event gets no more repair than an argument does. *Skipping the settings
//! question and answering the event anyway* would send a harness an `allow`
//! about a project SURE cannot place — and it could not record the event either,
//! because `Store::open` asks the same question of the same root and refuses it,
//! so the answer would be the only thing left and it would be about nothing.
//! That is the false green this repository exists to refuse.
//!
//! **Which way it errs: toward no evidence and a visible refusal.** On a
//! `SessionStart` there is no action a decision could have blocked, so the cost
//! of refusing is that session's history and one sentence on stderr; the cost of
//! the alternatives is a stored project root naming a directory the user never
//! meant. What a `SessionStart` gets from each harness package this repository
//! ships, and the source for each, is
//! `docs/integrations/HOOK_FAILURE_SEMANTICS.md` §2.3.

/// promising that the first matching request would spend it. Reading the
/// settings here describes them and grants nothing: what may run is still the
/// arbitrated answer of `Authority`, and a project file cannot raise it
/// (`P13-T009`).
///
/// The *tool* is read, and it is not the subject: the two are separate halves of
/// what a grant matches. A tool name is the harness's own vocabulary, and SURE
/// answers it **in the vocabulary that claims it** — the reading that keeps
/// Claude Code's `Edit` a change to a project file instead of also reading it
/// through Cursor's unrecognised-name fallback, which is the shape that let the
/// writer record a grant for `Edit` and then have no request from either harness
/// spend it (`P13-T010`'s second send-back). A name neither vocabulary claims
/// is `ArbitraryCommand`, so a user may still cover a tool SURE has never heard
/// of, and that is the one arm where a grant can be recorded for words no
/// request carries — the wasted minute rather than the wrong answer. The
/// **subject** stays unread: whether `rm -rf build/` or `.env` is dangerous is
/// decided when a request arrives, and a command line this function refused to
/// record would be a second rule about what is dangerous. So what the user reads
/// is what the settings in force leave for *their tool*, and a grant recorded
/// for words SURE would never name as dangerous is one it is never spent on —
/// which is the residual `docs/security/PROTECTION_MODE.md` states and this

///
/// The project is the one caller-side fact this command takes as given, because
