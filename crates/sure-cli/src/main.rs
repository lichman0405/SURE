#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! The `sure` command line entry point.
//!
//! This file is deliberately thin. It parses, asks the command what happened,
//! writes the answer down one of the two ways, and exits. Every decision it
//! could make lives one level in, where a test can reach it:
//!
//! | Decision | Where |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | what the command line accepts | [`cli`] |
//! | what a command does in this build | [`commands`] |
//! | how a result is written | [`report`] |
//! | what `sure doctor` says, in both forms | [`doctor`] |
//! | what `sure check --goal` stores, and what it refuses to claim | [`check`] |
//! | which stream, and which of the two paths | [`output`] |
//! | the exit status | `report::Report::exit_code` |
//!
//! `docs/architecture/CLI.md` is the contract a user reads.
//!
//! # Why the parse error is handled here rather than by `clap::Parser::parse`
//!
//! `parse` exits the process itself, which would put a status code in a
//! library's hands. Every status this program returns is listed in
//! `docs/architecture/CLI.md`, and one of them being clap's decision rather
//! than SURE's is how a documented table quietly becomes wrong. `try_parse`
//! hands the error back, and [`status_of`] is the whole of the mapping.
