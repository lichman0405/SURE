//! What a command hands back, and the two ways of writing it down.
//!
//! # One result, two renderers, no third path
//!
//! [`Report`] is the CLI's result vocabulary. Every command produces exactly one
//! of its variants, and each variant has a [`Report::human`] arm and a
//! [`Report::machine`] arm. The two matches are exhaustive and independent: a
//! new variant does not compile until both are written, so there is no state of
//! the world in which a result is renderable one way and not the other.
//!
//! They are independent on purpose. Deriving the human form from the JSON, or
//! the JSON from the human text, is the tempting shortcut and it is the reason
//! "human and machine output are separated" needs saying at all — one path would
//! then be a formatting of the other, and a field could exist in the form a
//! script reads while being absent from the form a person reads, with no test
//! able to name the difference.
//!
//! # The exit status
//!
//! Nothing else in this program decides one. [`Report::exit_code`] is the whole
//! mapping, and `docs/architecture/CLI.md` lists the same codes. A script that
//! reads only the exit status and a person who reads only the prose are looking
//! at the same decision.
//!
//! # The machine-readable frame
//!
//! One JSON object on one line, always with `sure_version`, `protocol_version`,
//! `command`, `outcome` and `exit_code`. The first two are there so that a bug
//! report containing a captured response says which build produced it — the two
//! things that make a stored answer unreadable are a newer SURE and a newer
//! protocol, and a response that does not name either invites the reader to
//! assume the current ones. `command` and `outcome` are what a reader switches
//! on, and `exit_code` is the same decision the process returned, so that a
//! script reading only the body and a script reading only the status are told
//! the same thing.
//!
//! Everything else a command found goes under `details`, one key, written by
//! that command's own module.
//!
//! This frame is **not** one of the seven documents in
//! `docs/architecture/PROTOCOL.md`. Those are statements about a project or an
//! event, each with a schema in `schemas/`; this is the envelope a command
//! answers in. `docs/architecture/PROTOCOL.md` records the distinction, because
//! a sentence there says "everything SURE writes" and a CLI response is written.
//!
//! # The one frame that is not this envelope
//!
//! [`Report::Mcp`] — one Model Context Protocol message on its way to a
//! harness — carries the message itself, because a JSON-RPC message is not a
//! CLI response and the caller reading it is reading `id` and `result`, not
//! `sure_version` and `command`. Wrapping one in the other would put SURE's
//! envelope between an MCP client and the protocol it speaks, and the whole
//! point of the bridge is that it speaks the protocol rather than a dialect of
//! it. It is the only variant with a frame of its own. What this envelope
//! exists for is still in the answer, where it belongs: every tool result
//! carries the command's own frame, unmodified, under `structuredContent.sure`.
