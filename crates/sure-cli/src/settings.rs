//! `sure config set`: writing one setting into the file only a person can write.
//!
//! # Why this command exists
//!
//! `P13-T009` settled which settings can grant what, and the answer left a hole
//! this command fills. Full recording and every execution mode other than
//! `inspect_only` are granted by the user's own settings file **and by nothing
//! else** — a checked project's `sure.yaml` may ask for them and can never grant
//! them (`Layer::can_grant`, `Authority::full_recording`,
//! `Authority::execution_mode`). On Windows that file is
//! `%APPDATA%\SURE\sure.yaml`, and before this task nothing in the build created
//! it, wrote it, or told a person it existed. The correct answer and the
//! reachable answer had come apart: SURE would report a setting as not in force
//! and give no way to put it in force that a user could find from the command
//! line.
//!
//! So this module writes that one file, on request, with a person's own words.
//! It writes **nothing else**: not the project's `sure.yaml` (which it may not
//! edit at all — see [`refuse_a_project_file`]), not the store, and not any file
//! the caller did not name through `sure_core::paths`.
//!
//! # What it will and will not write
//!
//! Every setting in this release falls into one of three groups, and the line
//! between them is *whether a value in the user's own file reaches anything*:
//!
//! * **Writable** ([`WRITABLE`]): the settings `Authority` arbitrates out of the
//!   user's own file, every one of which some other command then reads —
//!   `execution.*` reaches the pipeline's authorisation, `privacy.full_recording`
//!   and the retention reach the recording rules, `privacy.mode` and
//!   `protection.mode` reach the report and the hook's consent record.
//! * **Refused with a reason** ([`NOT_WRITABLE`]): settings that exist in
//!   `sure.yaml` and that this release reads from the *checked project's* file
//!   (or from nowhere at all), so writing them here would be a file that looks
//!   like a decision and is not one. `privacy.telemetry` is the sharpest case:
//!   nothing implements it, and the task that owns this command requires it to be
//!   refused rather than written silently.
//! * **Refused as unknown**: a name this build does not know, with the writable
//!   names listed, so that a typo is a refusal rather than a created file.
//!
//! # How the file is edited
//!
//! As **text**, one key at a time, never by re-rendering the document. A person's
//! settings file is one they wrote by hand, with comments explaining why they
//! chose what they chose; parsing it into a value and printing it back would
//! silently delete every one of those comments. So the edit finds the line the
//! setting is on and changes that line, and the whole file is compared afterwards
//! against the document that *should* have resulted:
//!
//! 1. the existing file is read and parsed by [`Config::from_yaml`] — the
//!    product's only reader — so a file this build cannot use is refused before
//!    anything is written to it;
//! 2. the edit is made as text;
//! 3. the result is parsed again, and compared leaf by leaf with the original
//!    document with exactly one leaf changed ([`with_leaf_set`]);
//! 4. the same reader is asked to accept the result, and its own words are the
//!    refusal if it does not.
//!
//! Step 3 is the one that makes a text editor safe here. A line-oriented edit can
//! land in the wrong block, and if it does, the two documents differ somewhere
//! else and the command refuses without writing — a visible refusal rather than a
//! settings file that says something the person did not ask for.
//!
//! # What the person is told
//!
//! Three sentences, and they are the acceptance criterion: one for a write, one
//! for a no-op, and one for a refusal. A person can tell a write from a no-op
//! without opening the file, and every one of the three names the file in the
//! operating system's own terms — `Path::display`, which on Windows is the path
//! Explorer shows.
