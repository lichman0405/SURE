//! The command line contract, checked where a user meets it: the process.
//!
//! # Why this file runs the binary
//!
//! The two acceptance criteria — that the commands parse, and that the human
//! and machine-readable output paths are separated — are claims about what a
//! *process* does. Which stream a byte went to, and what status the process
//! returned, are not observable from inside: the unit tests in `src/` check the
//! decisions, and this file checks that the decisions are what a shell sees.
//!
//! A test that called the renderers directly would pass while the binary wrote
//! both of them to stdout, which is precisely the failure the criterion exists
//! to rule out.
//!
//! # What is asserted
//!
//! 1. the status, for every command the docs list;
//! 2. that the human form of a refusal goes to stderr and the machine form to
//!    stdout, and that neither writes to the other's stream;
//! 3. that the machine form is one line of JSON, so a pipeline can read a
//!    stream of responses;
//! 4. that a command with nothing to do never exits 0 — SURE's own false green;
//! 5. that nothing in the crate can write to a stream outside `output.rs`;
//! 6. that the store's location is the caller's to name and no one else's, and
//!    that a full run of this file leaves the store of the person running it
//!    byte-identical.
//!
//! # Where these runs keep their evidence
//!
//! **Every process this file starts names a store with `--store-dir`**, in a
//! directory of its own under `target/tmp` — see [`a_store_of_our_own`]. Before
//! that flag existed, the runs that write (`sure check --goal`, `sure hook
//! ingest`) wrote the store of whoever ran the suite, and there was no
//! environment variable that could have stopped them: on Windows the per-user
//! data directory comes from `SHGetKnownFolderPath`, which ignores
//! `LOCALAPPDATA`. One test here names no store at all, and it is the one that
//! checks a caller who names nothing still gets the platform's own location; it
//! reads that store and compares its bytes before and after, so a redirect that
//! had been dropped fails a test rather than editing a history.

// The workspace forbids `unwrap`, `expect` and `panic` in shipped code, because
// a panic is a message nobody chose. A test is the one place they are the point:
// the panic *is* the report, and it names the value that was wrong.
