//! The Windows per-user install and uninstall flow, as a person meets it.
//!
//! `P15-T003`'s acceptance is that SURE installs the CLI to a documented
//! per-user path with no hidden background service and no administrator
//! requirement, that uninstall removes or preserves user data only with a clear
//! choice, and that the `PATH`/integration behavior is documented **and tested**.
//! All three are claims about what a process does to a filesystem, so this file
//! runs the two scripts and reads the filesystem back.
//!
//! # What it is really guarding
//!
//! `scripts/Install-Sure.ps1` installs into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SURE\bin`, which is
//! where eight launcher scripts across five integration packages already resolve
//! `sure.exe` — and which is **also** where `crates/sure-core/src/paths/mod.rs`
//! puts the user's evidence, `sure.db`. So an uninstall that walks the install
//! directory would destroy the history SURE exists to keep. The tests below are
//! written so that the failure they exist to catch is not "a file was left
//! behind" but "a file that was not the install's was removed": every case
//! plants something of the user's first and checks it byte for byte afterwards.
//!
//! Nothing here touches the real `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SURE`. The flow is always given
//! an `-InstallRoot` under this repository's git-ignored `target/tmp`, and the
//! launchers are given `LOCALAPPDATA` pointing at the same scratch directory, so
//! what they resolve is the install this test made. That is the only place the
//! store of whoever runs the suite could be edited from, and it is not reached.
//!
//! # The two archives these tests install
//!
//! Most of this file stages an archive of its own. `P15-T002`'s archive comes
//! from `scripts/Build-Release.ps1`, which refuses to package without the release
//! gate and takes minutes to run a release build, so those tests write the
//! *documented layout* — one top-level directory named
//! `sure-<version>-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` holding `sure.exe`, `LICENSE` and
//! `RELEASE.txt`, with a `sha256sum`-format `<archive>.sha256` beside it —
//! around the binary cargo just built. That archive is a real ZIP with real
//! bytes, but it is written by the same hand as the installer's expectations and
//! therefore cannot disagree with them: a drift in what `Build-Release.ps1`
//! emits would leave every one of those tests green.
//!
//! `the_installer_installs_the_archive_the_build_produced` stages nothing. It
//! installs the archive the build actually produced — `target/tmp/release/
//! sure-*-<target>.zip`, or whatever `SURE_RELEASE_ARCHIVE` names — and holds
//! the installer's own records against the build's. It is `#[ignore]`d, because
//! the workspace run has no archive to give it on a fresh runner: `ci.yml`
//! packages nothing at all, and every packaging job in `release.yml` runs
//! `cargo test --workspace` *before* it packages, so a test that needs an
//! artifact and says so by failing would be a permanent red in two workflows
//! that cannot do anything about it. It is run where the artifact exists —
//! `release.yml`'s `package-windows` job invokes it by name, with `--ignored`,
//! right after `Build-Release.ps1 -Phase All` — and by hand with `cargo test -p
//! sure-cli --test install_flow -- --ignored`. When it is run and this checkout
//! has no such archive it **fails**, naming the command that makes one and the
//! variable that points this test at one made elsewhere. A check that quietly
//! does nothing when the artifact is absent is the defect this test exists to
//! remove, so there is no path through it that reports a pass without having
//! installed an archive `Build-Release.ps1` wrote.

// The whole flow is Windows-only: a per-user `%LOCALAPPDATA%` install, a
// PowerShell script, and launchers that resolve `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SURE\bin`.
// `crates/sure-testkit/tests/hook_failure_semantics.rs` covers the Unix half of
// the launchers, and `CLAUDE.md`'s portability requirement is about the Rust
// core, not about this file.
#![cfg(windows)]
// The workspace forbids `unwrap`, `expect` and `panic` in shipped code, because
// a panic is a message nobody chose. A test is the one place they are the point:
// the panic *is* the report, and it names the value that was wrong.
