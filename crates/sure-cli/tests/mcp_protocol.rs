//! The MCP bridge as a caller meets it: a process, a pipe, and JSON.
//!
//! # Why this file runs the binary
//!
//! `src/mcp.rs` decides what to answer and its tests check those decisions. The
//! claims this file checks are the ones only a process can make:
//!
//! 1. the handshake and the version negotiation happen on the wire;
//! 2. the protocol messages are the *only* thing on stdout, and the session
//!    summary is not one of them;
//! 3. every tool answers with what the command line behind it answers — the
//!    same frame for a program, the same words for a person — which is the
//!    check that has to survive the day those commands start working;
//! 4. no tool reports success for a project that was not checked;
//! 5. a caller cannot reach around the CLI to change the execution mode, the
//!    privacy settings or the protection policy;
//! 6. the process ends when its caller closes the stream, with the status the
//!    session report says it returns.
//!
//! The server is driven the way a harness drives it: the test writes
//! newline-delimited JSON to its standard input and reads lines back from its
//! standard output. Every read has a deadline, so a server that stopped
//! answering fails this test instead of hanging it.
//!
//! # Where the sessions keep their evidence
//!
//! Every session and every command line here names a store with `--store-dir`,
//! in a directory of its own under `target/tmp` — see [`a_store_of_our_own`].
//! `sure_check` routes through `check::run`, so a session that named no store
//! would read the store of whoever ran the suite; a check with no goal does not
//! write one, but a test that read the machine's history would still be a test
//! whose result depends on it, and one test here did exactly that —
//! `sure_status_answers_about_this_build_and_never_about_a_project` compared a
//! record count read from the developer's store, and failed whenever anything
//! else on the machine wrote a row while it ran. Both ends are fixed: the count
//! now comes from a store this file made, and nothing here reaches the other.

// The workspace forbids `unwrap`, `expect` and `panic` in shipped code, because
// a panic is a message nobody chose. A test is the one place they are the point:
// the panic *is* the report, and it names the value that was wrong.
