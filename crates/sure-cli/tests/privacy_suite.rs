//! The privacy and security integration suite: `fixtures/privacy/manifest.json`.
//!
//! # Why this file exists
//!
//! P13-T008's acceptance is two lines — *full recording off by default* and
//! *mandatory secret/protection fixtures pass* — and neither is a claim about a
//! function. The first is a claim about what is on disk after a real `sure`
//! process has run, and the second is a claim that a *set* of fixtures exists,
//! is enumerable, and passes. So this file is a runner rather than a test of its
//! own: it reads the corpus, and every case in it either drives the real binary
//! or points at the test that already drives the same behaviour somewhere this
//! file cannot reach.
//!
//! # What "mandatory" means here, and what binds it
//!
//! Three documents already said a mandatory fixture set exists and blocks
//! release — `docs/testing/ADVERSARIAL_FIXTURES.md`, `docs/product/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md`
//! and `docs/product/PRODUCT_EVALS.md` — and until this corpus existed, nothing
//! in `crates/` bound the word to anything. The binding is
//! [`every_case_binds_a_sentence_a_document_still_makes`]: each case names a
//! document and a sentence in it, and the suite fails if the sentence is gone.
//! A promise that is withdrawn takes its fixture with it, rather than leaving a
//! fixture nobody promised and a promise nobody tests.
//!
//! # What this file does not re-prove
//!
//! A behaviour already proved at the layer this file would prove it at is not
//! written again here. It is written as a `covered_by` entry: a pointer at the
//! file and the tests in it, checked to exist by
//! [`every_pointer_names_a_test_that_exists`], so the corpus is a complete
//! inventory of the acceptance rather than a second copy of the test suite.
//!
//! # What it cannot reach, and says so
//!
//! It is recorded in the manifest's `not_confirmed` and printed by
//! [`the_corpus_prints_what_it_could_not_confirm`]. One entry stands there, the
//! seam with P14-T008's three dangerous-action scenarios.
//!
//! # The `--goal` case asserts both halves now
//!
//! It used to be the example here of a thing this file could not reach, and it
//! is worth keeping the shape of that in view. `sure check --goal` printed the
//! words that were typed under a sentence about the record, while the record
//! held the redacted form; the case
//! `a-secret-typed-into-a-goal-reaches-the-store-only-redacted` asserted the
//! store half and the report half was recorded as unsettled. `P15-T024` decided
//! which rule wins — the store's redaction, with the goal not exempt from it —
//! and `check.rs`'s `record_goal` now reads the row back and hands that text to
//! every surface. So the case asserts the report too: no byte under the store
//! directory holds the credential, the redacted text does, the report shows that
//! same text, and the credential is in neither stream. The manifest entry and
//! this paragraph went with the gap.
//!
//! # The settings file a case supplies, and the one it must not
//!
//! A case may carry a `settings` block: a file this suite writes under the
//! case's own scratch directory, named on the run's command line with
//! `--settings-file`. That is the surface the user's own settings file is
//! reached by, and it exists because the alternative is a suite that cannot
//! observe consent at all — see `docs/architecture/CLI.md`, which says what the
//! flag is for and what it may grant.
//!
//! **It is a testing and automation surface and it is not a way to escalate.** A
//! settings file inside the project the run is told about is refused before it
//! is read, whoever named it: the file that says what SURE may do is the user's
//! own word, and the project being judged is the one thing that must not be able
//! to write it. The case `a-settings-file-the-project-could-write-grants-nothing`
//! attempts exactly that and asserts the refusal. The machine's own settings file
//! is never written, named, or read for a decision by anything in this file: what
//! the default would be is observed by
//! [`no_settings_file_at_all_is_the_premise_the_binary_cases_run_under`], which
//! is about the real path, and every case that supplies a settings file says so
//! in its own `settings` block.
//!
//! # Where these runs keep their evidence
//!
//! Every process this file starts names a store with `--store-dir`, in a scratch
//! directory under `target/tmp/privacy suite` that is removed when the test that
//! made it ends. The store of the person running the suite is read before and
//! after each case and compared, because "the run went somewhere else" is the
//! property that keeps this suite from editing somebody's history.

// The workspace forbids `unwrap`, `expect` and `panic` in shipped code, because
// a panic is a message nobody chose. A test is the one place they are the point:
// the panic *is* the report, and it names the value that was wrong.
