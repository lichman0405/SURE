//! The privacy and security integration suite: `fixtures/privacy/manifest.json`.
//!
//! # Why this file exists
//!
//! P13-T008's acceptance is two lines — *full recording off by default* and
//! *mandatory secret/protection fixtures pass* — and neither is a claim about a
//! function. The first is a claim about what is on disk after a real `sure`
//! process has run, and the second is a claim that a *set* of fixtures exists,
//! is enumerable, and passes. So this file is a runner rather than a test of its
//! own: it reads the corpus, and every case in it either drives the real binary
//! or points at the test that already drives the same behaviour somewhere this
//! file cannot reach.
//!
//! # What "mandatory" means here, and what binds it
//!
//! Three documents already said a mandatory fixture set exists and blocks
//! release — `docs/testing/ADVERSARIAL_FIXTURES.md`, `docs/product/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md`
//! and `docs/product/PRODUCT_EVALS.md` — and until this corpus existed, nothing
//! in `crates/` bound the word to anything. The binding is
//! [`every_case_binds_a_sentence_a_document_still_makes`]: each case names a
//! document and a sentence in it, and the suite fails if the sentence is gone.
//! A promise that is withdrawn takes its fixture with it, rather than leaving a
//! fixture nobody promised and a promise nobody tests.
//!
//! # What this file does not re-prove
//!
//! A behaviour already proved at the layer this file would prove it at is not
//! written again here. It is written as a `covered_by` entry: a pointer at the
//! file and the tests in it, checked to exist by
//! [`every_pointer_names_a_test_that_exists`], so the corpus is a complete
//! inventory of the acceptance rather than a second copy of the test suite.
//!
//! # What it cannot reach, and says so
//!
//! Two things a reader might expect are not here, and both are recorded in the
//! manifest's `not_confirmed` and printed by
//! [`the_corpus_prints_what_it_could_not_confirm`]:
//!
//! - **a full recording opened by a process.** The consent is read from the
//!   user's own settings file (`Authority::full_recording`), which on Windows is
//!   `%APPDATA%\SURE\sure.yaml`; no flag and no environment variable moves it
//!   (`Paths::discover_at` moves the store and not the settings), and no test may
//!   write the file of the person running the suite. The recording is therefore
//!   opened in-process, at the store layer, and the case says which layer it is
//!   at.
//! - **the `--goal` the report shows and the one the store holds.** They differ
//!   today. The corpus asserts the half that is settled (the store redacts) and
//!   records the half that is not.
//!
//! # Where these runs keep their evidence
//!
//! Every process this file starts names a store with `--store-dir`, in a scratch
//! directory under `target/tmp/privacy suite` that is removed when the test that
//! made it ends. The store of the person running the suite is read before and
//! after each case and compared, because "the run went somewhere else" is the
//! property that keeps this suite from editing somebody's history.

// The workspace forbids `unwrap`, `expect` and `panic` in shipped code, because
// a panic is a message nobody chose. A test is the one place they are the point:
// the panic *is* the report, and it names the value that was wrong.
