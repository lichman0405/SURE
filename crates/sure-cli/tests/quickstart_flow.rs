//! The Windows quickstart, and the journey it describes.
//!
//! `P15-T014`'s acceptance is that *"a nontechnical Windows user can install
//! CLI + one harness integration and run first check"*. `docs/development/
//! QUICKSTART_WINDOWS.md` is that walk written out, and this file is the two
//! things a document like that needs to be worth anything here:
//!
//! 1. **The journey, run.** Section 3 installs an archive, section 4 installs
//!    an integration, section 5 runs a check and reads the verdict. Every one of
//!    those steps is a process and a filesystem, so this file does them rather
//!    than describing them: it stages a real archive, runs
//!    `scripts/Install-Sure.ps1` into a scratch per-user directory, runs
//!    `integrations/claude-code/scripts/install.ps1 -ForceCopy` against it with
//!    `SURE_BIN` removed and nothing on `PATH`, and runs `sure check` with the
//!    binary the install wrote.
//! 2. **The document's claims, measured.** `docs/development/INSTALL_WINDOWS.md`
//!    says what the standard is at *"How 'documented and tested' is satisfied
//!    here"*: a documentation claim is named to the test that measures it. The
//!    rules at the bottom of this file hold the quickstart to the same standard,
//!    and `every_rule_is_turned_red_by_an_edit_that_breaks_it` shows each one
//!    failing when the thing it names is taken away.
//!
//! # The one claim this file cannot make
//!
//! The quickstart's section 1 says there is no published archive and that the
//! only path to one today needs a Rust toolchain. That is not a limitation of
//! this file — it is the finding the task was for, and what can be measured is
//! the reason for it: the rules `release_workflow_violations` and
//! `dry_run_violations` read the two workflow files and hold the tree to what
//! the document says about them. The moment either stops being true, the
//! document is wrong and this goes red.
//!
//! # The archive these tests install
//!
//! The same staged archive `crates/sure-cli/tests/install_flow.rs` installs, for
//! the same reason: `scripts/Build-Release.ps1 -Phase All` refuses to package
//! without the release gate and takes a full release build, so the *documented
//! layout* is staged around the binary cargo just built. `the_two_stagers_are_one
//! _stager` below is what keeps this file from being a second invention: it reads
//! `install_flow.rs`'s own copy of the staging script out of its bytes and
//! requires the copy here to be character for character the same.
//!
//! Nothing here touches the real `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SURE`. Every process is given a
//! `LOCALAPPDATA` under this repository's git-ignored `target/tmp`, so what the
//! installer writes, what the integration installer resolves and what the check
//! would record all land in a directory this test made — with one deliberate
//! exception, `a_check_leaves_the_store_of_the_person_running_it_byte_identical`,
//! which runs the documented command the documented way and asserts the bytes of
//! that person's own store are unchanged. That test is where the claim "a check
//! writes nothing" is measured against a real machine rather than a scratch one,
//! and it is the shape `crates/sure-cli/tests/cli_contract.rs` already uses.

// Windows-only: a per-user `%LOCALAPPDATA%` install, two PowerShell scripts, and
// a plugin destination under the same directory. `CLAUDE.md`'s portability
// requirement is about the Rust core, not about this file.
#![cfg(windows)]
// The workspace forbids `unwrap`, `expect` and `panic` in shipped code, because
// a panic is a message nobody chose. A test is the one place they are the point:
// the panic *is* the report, and it names the value that was wrong.
