//! `P18-T011`'s clause 1, pinned at both renderers a reader actually opens.
//!
//! > *Runtime results reach the human and machine reports through the existing
//! > renderers.*
//!
//! The route was already there — `crate::check::finished` hands
//! [`human_report::render_verdict`] the run's own schedule and report, and
//! `crate::check::verdict_machine` serializes [`json_report::build_json_report`]
//! into the frame — so the two tests here call those two renderers with what a
//! real run of the pipeline produced and assert that **the answer the run
//! produced for a scheduled check is the sentence a person reads and the
//! sentence a script reads**.
//!
//! # What is a runtime result here
//!
//! The project declares `scripts.test` and a package manager, so the check is
//! planned rather than left as a declaration; the user's own configuration file
//! (outside the project, where only the user's own file may grant) allows
//! execution, so the plan admits it. The runner is
//! `ProcessRunner::new` over a [`Cancellation`] this file cancels **before the
//! run begins** — the product's own runner and a real cancellation, which
//! `sure_core::process` reads before it starts anything — so the check is
//! carried all the way to the runner and the row that comes back is the
//! runner's own answer for a process that did not start. Nothing is started on
//! the machine that grades this, which is what makes the fixture usable here at
//! all.
//!
//! # The half that is the false green
//!
//! The second test runs the same project with no grant at all, through the
//! product's own entry point ([`check::run_with`](sure_cli::check::run_with)).
//! The check is then refused by the plan and the report has to say so: listed as
//! not checked with the frozen sentence, not ready for hand-off in the machine
//! report, and never a pass. A build that dropped the row would satisfy the
//! first test and fail here.
//!
//! # What these two tests do not measure
//!
//! The CLI's runner is not injected: `check::run_with` takes no runner, so the
//! first test builds the run the way `crate::check` builds it (`Config`,
//! `Authority::execution()`, `store: None`) and hands it a runner that starts
//! nothing. What that pins is the renderers and the settings route between the
//! run and them — not that `crate::check` passes those settings, which the
//! second test pins from the other side, with the product's own entry point.
