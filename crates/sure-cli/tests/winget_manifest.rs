//! The WinGet manifest template, and the script that renders it from an archive.
//!
//! `P15-T004`'s acceptance is that the template "references stable release
//! artifact/checksum and documents update process", and that publication itself
//! may stay external. The hazard behind that sentence is the reason this file
//! exists: a manifest is a set of confident claims about a file that is not in
//! this repository — a version, a URL and a SHA-256 — and a plausible-looking
//! 64-hex constant in a committed YAML is exactly the artefact SURE exists to
//! refuse. So the tests below are in two groups:
//!
//! * the **template** is read as text, on every platform, and has to carry the
//!   two placeholders and no digest at all;
//! * the **script** (`scripts/New-WingetManifest.ps1`) is run against a real
//!   archive, and what it writes has to match the bytes it was given — with
//!   falsifiers for the three ways that could be quietly untrue (a corrupt
//!   archive, a hand-edited digest, a version the binary does not report).
//!
//! # What "a real archive" means here, and what it does not
//!
//! `P15-T002`'s archive is produced by `scripts/Build-Release.ps1`, which
//! refuses to package without the release gate and takes minutes to run a
//! release build. A test cannot depend on that, so — exactly as
//! `crates/sure-cli/tests/install_flow.rs` does — this file stages the
//! *documented layout* around the binary cargo just built. What the script
//! reads is a real ZIP with real bytes in it and a real `sure.exe` inside; what
//! it is not is the release build, and this comment is where that difference is
//! stated rather than left for a reader to assume.
//!
//! One thing the staged archive does carry that a stand-in would not: its name
//! and the version the binary reports are **the same string**, because the test
//! asks the binary for its own version first. That is the property the manifest
//! depends on, so a fixture that made it up would be testing a fiction.
//!
//! # What this file cannot check
//!
//! `winget validate` reads a manifest and answers about its schema. It does not
//! download an archive, and it cannot: `InstallerUrl` points at a GitHub release
//! asset that does not exist yet. Nothing here installs a package (`winget
//! install` changes the machine, and the rules this task was given forbid it),
//! so "WinGet installs this correctly" is **not** measured anywhere in this
//! repository. `docs/development/INSTALL_WINGET.md` says so where a reader will
//! meet it, and `install_flow.rs` is the file that measures what SURE's own
//! installer does.
//!
//! The template half of this file needs no Windows; the script and launcher
//! halves are gated, because a per-user `%LOCALAPPDATA%` install and a
//! PowerShell host are Windows things and `CLAUDE.md`'s portability requirement
//! is about the Rust core.
//!
//! # One `winget` at a time
//!
//! `cargo test` runs one binary's cases in parallel, and this file has four that
//! end in `winget validate`. Two of those at once make winget exit
//! `-1978335231` — a failure to run the check at all, not a verdict on the
//! manifest — and the run that meets it fails about one time in three. Every
//! call here that can reach winget holds one process-wide lock, so the file
//! passes however cargo schedules it. The lock's own comment has the
//! measurement.

// The workspace forbids `unwrap`, `expect` and `panic` in shipped code, because
// a panic is a message nobody chose. A test is the one place they are the point:
// the panic *is* the report, and it names the value that was wrong.
