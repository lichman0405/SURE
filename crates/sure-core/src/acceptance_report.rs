//! The acceptance report: `evaluation/acceptance-manifest.json`, measured.
//!
//! # The sentence this module exists for
//!
//! `evaluation/README.md` states the release contract's requirement in one line:
//!
//! > *The release report must include actual observed outcome for every case.*
//!
//! **Actual observed outcome.** Every row below is produced by driving the
//! machinery that grades its case — the five candidate scanners, `db_migrations`,
//! `external_service`, `claim_checker`, the pipeline, `hook_protection` — and
//! never by reading `expected_severity` out of the manifest or the fixture's own
//! `scenario.json` and printing it back. That distinction is the whole of the
//! module: a report that restated the requirement as the outcome would read
//! green over exactly the cases where the two are known to differ, which is the
//! false green this repository exists to catch one level up.
//!
//! # Why this is a module and not a `sure` subcommand
//!
//! The corpus is a repository artefact. `evaluation/` and `fixtures/adversarial/`
//! are tracked files that exist in a checkout and not in a user's installation,
//! so a `sure eval` would either bake the build machine's path into a shipped
//! binary or fail on every user's machine. The runner is
//! `crates/sure-core/tests/acceptance_report_runner.rs`, which is where every
//! other grader of this manifest already lives and where the corpus path is
//! resolved the way this repository resolves it.
//!
//! # What this module does not do
//!
//! It opens no store, starts no process, and writes nothing: [`acceptance_report`]
//! takes a repository root and returns a value. One case — `repair-regression` —
//! cannot be observed here at all, and the reason is a rule rather than an
//! oversight: `crates/sure-core/tests/spawn_sites.rs`'s rule two forbids any file
//! under `crates/**/src/**` outside its own allowed list from naming the type the
//! process runner is handed, and observing that case means running the fixture's
//! two node checks. The module answers `cannot_confirm` for it with that reason
//! written into the row, and [`acceptance_report_with`] is the seam the runner
//! supplies the real measurement through — so a reader can always see which of
//! the two observed a row from the row itself.
