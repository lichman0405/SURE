//! What SURE asks a browser to do, and the one place a browser's answer becomes
//! a verdict.
//!
//! `P3-T011` acceptance: *"Browser unavailable => skipped/unknown."* /
//! *"Browser automation is isolated from core verdict semantics."*
//!
//! # The seam, and what a driver is not allowed to say
//!
//! [`BrowserDriver`] is the interface. A driver is whatever can drive a real
//! browser — a Playwright installation, a Puppeteer script, something this build
//! has never heard of — and it implements one method, which returns a
//! [`Report`].
//!
//! **A [`Report`] is an [`Absence`] or an [`Observation`], and neither is a
//! verdict.** Neither type contains a [`CheckStatus`], neither contains a
//! [`CheckResult`], and the trait's signature gives a driver no way to return
//! either: the only thing a driver can produce is *what it saw*. The one place a
//! browser's answer becomes a verdict is [`Report::verdict`], and the one place
//! the status behind it is decided is [`Report::status`]. Nothing else in this
//! file returns either type, and `tests/browser_probe.rs` counts that rather
//! than trusting it.
//!
//! ```text
//! BrowserDriver::observe  ->  Report  ->  Report::status      ->  CheckStatus
//!                                 \-->  Report::verdict      ->  CheckResult
//! ```
//!
//! **What this does not claim.** The interface keeps a driver from *spelling* a
//! verdict; it does not keep a driver from being wrong. A driver that reports
//! `complete: true` and no problems has said something false about a page that
//! threw, and nothing here can tell. What is enforced is the direction that
//! matters: **a driver cannot hand SURE a status, so no driver can put a green
//! in a report by asking for one.** The observations are still the driver's to
//! get wrong, and the way SURE finds that out is a second driver, not this
//! module.
//!
//! # Absence is a value, and it is the first acceptance sentence
//!
//! A browser that is not installed is not a failure of the project and not a
//! pass for it. [`Report::absent`] carries an [`Absence`], [`AbsenceReason`] maps
//! one-to-one onto the frozen [`NotCheckedReason`], and **every one of the five
//! reasons is `skipped`** — never a pass, and never a `fail` about code that was
//! never run. The mapping is total and it is checked over
//! [`AbsenceReason::ALL`], because a sixth reason added later that quietly landed
//! on a `pass` is exactly the shape of defect this repository is built against.
//!
//! **A missing browser is not a scope limit, and the difference is what a
//! report does with it.** Four of the five reasons map to a
//! [`NotCheckedReason`] whose
//! [`is_scope_limit`](NotCheckedReason::is_scope_limit) is false, so a *critical*
//! browser check that could not run **blocks green** rather than politely
//! disappearing. That is the deliberate reading of "unavailable => skipped": the
//! check did not happen, and a project whose interface was never looked at is
//! not a project SURE has checked.
//!
//! **The fifth reason is the project switching the check off**, and what that
//! buys is smaller than it sounds. It stops the check *blocking* the run, and it
//! does not make the run green: the frozen [`aggregate`](sure_domain::status::aggregate)
//! keeps an out-of-scope critical check visible, so the run lands on
//! *needs attention* and the report still says the interface was not looked at.
//! A user who wants the browser check off is entitled to say so; they are not
//! entitled to be told their interface was fine.
//!
//! [`absence`] is the part of that SURE decides by itself — the project switched
//! the check off, or the permission to reach a service was never granted — and
//! it is a function here rather than a rule each caller re-implements, because
//! two callers ordering those two questions differently would report two
//! different reasons for one situation.
//!
//! # The false green this module is arranged against
//!
//! **A browser that was stopped early has not seen the whole page, so it has not
//! seen the absence of errors either.** An [`Observation`] carries `complete`,
//! and an incomplete look that reported no problems is
//! [`CheckStatus::Unknown`] — not a pass. It is the distinction
//! [`ProbeOutcome::NoAnswer`](crate::probe::ProbeOutcome::NoAnswer) draws one
//! module over, where a connection that was accepted and said nothing is
//! `Unknown` rather than a pass, and it is the single most likely way for a
//! browser check to lie: every driver that runs out of time reports "no errors
//! found".
//!
//! **A pass here says one narrow thing**: this address was opened, the page
//! reached, and nothing was reported wrong before the look ended. It does not
//! say the interface works, that it looks right, that a user can do anything
//! with it, or that the thing the project claims is present is present. **A
//! title is the line a reader skims**, so the title is exactly
//! `browser probe: <address>` — the words name the instrument and the address
//! names what was looked at, and a test asserts that string exactly rather than
//! asserting the absence of words a later edit could reintroduce.
//!
//! # What is missing
//!
//! **No driver is implemented here, and no browser is started.** Finding one,
//! launching it and driving it is the adapter, which is `P5-T004`; this module
//! is the interface that adapter implements and the mapping its answers go
//! through. Nothing here builds a [`std::process::Command`], so the spawn census
//! in `tests/spawn_sites.rs` is unchanged by this file.
//!
//! **The loopback rule is [`Endpoint`]'s**, and it is reused rather than
//! restated — see [`Target`]. A browser will navigate to the internet happily,
//! which is why the subject of a check is a type and not a `String`.
