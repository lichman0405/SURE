//! Starting the browser, and finding the port it chose.
//!
//! This is the only file in the product that starts a browser, and it is the
//! fourth entry in `crates/sure-core/tests/spawn_sites.rs`'s census — which is
//! the check that exists so that a new way for SURE to run something cannot be
//! added without somebody reading the paragraph above the list.
//!
//! # Why the browser is started directly rather than through the runner
//!
//! [`crate::process`] is how SURE runs *a project's* commands, and the door into
//! it is `Enforcement::admitted`, which classifies a program by name and treats
//! one it does not recognise as capable of anything. A browser is not in that
//! table, so a browser cannot be started through it — correctly, because the
//! runner's contract is about the project's code and this is not the project's
//! code.
//!
//! **The browser is SURE's own tool, chosen by SURE from a table compiled into
//! this binary.** That is the same shape as
//! [`crate::fingerprint::git`](crate::fingerprint::git), which holds a program
//! name rather than calling for `git` where it is needed, and for the same
//! reason. What follows from that is the security property worth stating: the
//! address SURE opens comes from the project, and **nothing else does**.
//!
//! # Where the address is, and why not on the command line
//!
//! `--remote-debugging-port=0` asks the operating system for a free port, and
//! the browser writes the port it got into `DevToolsActivePort` inside its
//! profile directory. SURE reads it from there.
//!
//! **The page's address is never a command-line argument.** It is sent later, as
//! a `Page.navigate` command over the debugging connection, so there is no
//! argument vector for a project-supplied path to be injected into — no quoting
//! rule to get right, no `--` to place, and nothing that behaves differently
//! because a path began with a dash. `CLAUDE.md`'s rule about preferring typed
//! arguments to shell strings is satisfied here by there being no string.
//!
//! # The profile directory
//!
//! A browser started with remote debugging **refuses to use a profile that is
//! already the default one**, which is what stops a page from reaching the
//! debugging port of the browser a person is using. SURE creates a private
//! directory under the system temporary directory for each run, starts the
//! browser against that, and removes it afterwards. Nothing of the user's is
//! opened, read or written, and a run leaves no profile behind for the next one
//! to inherit.
