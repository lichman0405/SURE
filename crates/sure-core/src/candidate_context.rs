/// # Which separators this reads, and which it does not
///
/// **The argument is a `Path` SURE produced itself, not text that arrived from
/// outside the process.** Both call shapes in this crate are like that: the
/// candidate scanners hand over the entry [`Discovery`](crate::discover::Discovery)
/// walked, and the two detectors that classify a path they read out of a file
/// (`route_consistency`, `ui_action_bridge`) hand over text this crate rendered
/// with [`display_path`](crate::scan::display_path), which joins components with
/// `/` on every platform deliberately. So there is no ambiguity to resolve:
/// Windows treats `/` as a separator too, so a rendered path classifies the same
/// way on all three platforms, and a walked path cannot be read any way other
/// than the one the filesystem gave it.
///
/// **Text from a harness is the other case, and this function is deliberately
/// not where it is answered.** A harness may send either separator, and its
/// paths describe a machine that is not necessarily this one; `hook_protection`
/// states that rule and applies it (`folded`, which replaces `\` with `/` on
/// every platform) so that the reading happens once, at the boundary where the
/// text arrives. Folding here instead would be wrong in the other direction: on
/// Unix a backslash is an ordinary character in a file name, and a project with
/// a file genuinely called `tests\foo.rs` in its root would be classified as
/// living in a `tests/` directory that does not exist.
///
/// # What the answer costs a verdict
///
/// This classification becomes [`Reach`](crate::finding_gravity::Reach), and
/// `Reach` is the gate that decides the severity of every candidate found in the
/// file (`finding_gravity::gravity_of`): `NotProduction` returns `note` for every
/// gap kind, and `note` is what `is_informational` calls "too weak to show as
/// material". Reading a path the other way therefore moves a finding across the
/// line between two different sentences — an unfinished marker in a file read as
/// product is `non_blocking` and shown, and the same marker in a file read as a
/// test is `note` and not shown as material at all. That is the intended
/// direction (a mock in `tests/` must not become a claim about shipping code),
/// and it is also why a wrong answer here is not cosmetic in either direction:
/// it either invents a finding about test scaffolding or hides one about the
/// product.
///
/// `root` and `graph` are available for future component-aware heuristics;
/// the current implementation uses conventional directory and file-name patterns.
