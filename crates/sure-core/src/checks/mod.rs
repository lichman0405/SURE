//! The checks a discovered project's own declarations turn into.
//!
//! This is step 4 of `docs/architecture/CHECK_PIPELINE.md` — *"Plan
//! static/dynamic checks and execution trust requirements."* — and it is the
//! first place in the product where a check is proposed.
//! [`crate::schedule`] is the machinery that orders and gates proposals, and
//! until this module existed nothing handed it one; `tests/check_schedule.rs`
//! says in its own documentation that it is written to fail on the day that
//! changed, and that day is `P4-T002`.
//!
//! # It adds no file access of its own
//!
//! Every fact a check here rests on is a field of a discovery result. Nothing in
//! this module opens a manifest, resolves a dependency, looks at
//! `node_modules`, or runs anything: the reading is [`crate::discover`]'s job
//! and this layer only decides what the reading means for a plan. That is not a
//! style preference — a proposer that read a file the scan had not walked would
//! be able to propose a check on evidence the report cannot point at, and
//! `docs/architecture/EVIDENCE_MODEL.md` calls an anchorless claim unsupported.
//!
//! # The two sentences this layer is arranged around
//!
//! **A check SURE would run is gated by the execution mode, and the gating
//! happens elsewhere.** Every check proposed here declares an
//! [`ActionKind`](sure_domain::execution::ActionKind) that
//! [`executes_project_code`](sure_domain::execution::ActionKind::executes_project_code)
//! answers `true` for, so under
//! [`InspectOnly`](sure_domain::execution::ExecutionMode::InspectOnly) every one
//! of them is refused by [`decide`](sure_domain::execution::decide) and comes
//! back from [`CheckSchedule`](crate::schedule::CheckSchedule) as an entry that
//! would not run. Nothing in this module makes that decision — it cannot, since
//! a decision is not a property of a check — and
//! `a_declared_check_runs_only_under_a_mode_that_allows_it` is where that is
//! held rather than asserted.
//!
//! **A command the project does not have never becomes a pass.** This is the
//! half that has no plan entry to hide in. Where a project gives SURE no command
//! for a check, there is nothing to schedule, and the honest answer is a
//! [`MissingCommand`]: an identity, the title the check would have had, and why
//! there is no command for it. [`MissingCommand::not_checked`] turns one into a
//! [`CheckResult`] by way of the domain's own `not_run` constructor, so the only
//! status it can produce is a *skipped* one — and the test
//! `every_missing_command_is_skipped_and_none_of_them_is_a_pass` says so over
//! the whole vocabulary of reasons rather than over the ones somebody thought
//! of.
//!
//! # The vocabulary gap this layer exists to name
//!
//! [`NotCheckedReason`] is frozen and has ten variants, and **none of them means
//! "the project declares this and what it declares is not something SURE can
//! run"**. The nearest is [`NotApplicable`](NotCheckedReason::NotApplicable) —
//! *"This check does not apply to your project."* — which is close for a check
//! the project declares no command for and false for one where the project
//! declared a command and wrote it in a shape that is not a command.
//!
//! [`MissingKind`] is SURE's own answer, and it is the shape
//! [`crate::browser`]'s `AbsenceReason` already has: **the frozen reason is what
//! a report groups by, and SURE's own sentence is what it prints.** The two are
//! separate because they answer separate questions, and because the frozen
//! enum's `is_scope_limit` is load-bearing —
//! [`blocks_green`](sure_domain::status::CheckResult::blocks_green) reads it to
//! decide whether a critical check that did not run holds the run out of green —
//! so the choice is not free and each variant below argues for its own.
//!
//! # What it does not do
//!
//! **It does not decide whether a check passes.** There is no result here except
//! the skipped one a missing command produces, and no path from this module to
//! [`CheckStatus`](sure_domain::status::CheckStatus) other than through
//! `CheckResult::not_run`.
//!
//! **It does not run anything.** Nothing here builds a
//! [`Command`](std::process::Command); the execution trust requirements the
//! acceptance names are the [`ActionKind`](sure_domain::execution::ActionKind)
//! each proposal declares, which is the same thing
//! `tests/spawn_sites.rs` counts the callers of.
//!
//! **It is not the only proposer.** `P4-T003` added [`python`] beside [`node`],
//! `P4-T004` added [`rust`] beside them, and the reason the identifier scheme
//! lives here rather than in any one of them is that the identifiers share a
//! namespace: two ecosystems describing one directory must not name one check
//! twice. [`MissingKind`] is the vocabulary they have in common without any of
//! them producing all of it, and [`evidence_of`] is the second thing they share
//! without sharing a rule — it is the one door from a finished check to the
//! evidence it is worth, and it takes the state off the result rather than from
//! its caller. [`python`]'s documentation said `P4-T004` would add a third
//! proposer and that the module would be a diff to this paragraph; it was.
//!
//! # What the three proposers share now that they propose work
//!
//! Since `P18-T003` a proposer hands over typed work rather than a rendered
//! command, and the parts all three of them need are here: [`command_operation`]
//! turns a program, an argument vector and a directory into the operation a check
//! carries, [`component_directory`] derives a member's directory from the manifest
//! path the scan spells it by, and [`CHECK_LIMITS`] is the one deadline and output
//! bound every declared check runs under. **They are here rather than repeated in
//! each proposer because they are policy**, and three copies of a deadline are
//! three deadlines.
//!
//! What is deliberately *not* here is any way to get a program name or an argument
//! vector out of text. Each proposer builds those from its own typed discovery
//! values — [`node`] from a script's own name and the package manager, [`python`]
//! from an installer and a tool, [`rust`] from `cargo` and a subcommand — and a
//! shared function taking a rendered line would be the parse
//! `docs/adr/0014-planned-check-execution-contract.md` rejected, moved one module
//! up rather than avoided.
//!
//! **It witnesses nothing about whether these checks are the right ones.** A
//! `package.json` that declares `"test": "true"` gets a test check that passes,
//! and nothing here can tell. Choosing good checks is not a thing a table of
//! conventions can do, and the module says so rather than implying otherwise —
//! the same limit [`crate::browser`] states about its drivers.
//!
//! **A detector's proposal needs an operation too, and it has no program to
//! name.** Since `P18-T003` every proposed check carries one, so the places that
//! propose from a *reading* rather than from a declared command — the candidate
//! scanners, the runtime probes, the flow steps and the corpus fixtures — carry
//! a [`PrecomputedEvidence`](crate::planned_work::PrecomputedEvidence) built from
//! the reading they made. `P18-T003` gave every one of them one shared
//! placeholder for that and named `P18-T004` as its owner; `P18-T004` removed it,
//! and each site now writes its own detector's observation. Every one of them is
//! a *candidate*, because a reading settles nothing about a project that was
//! never run — and a candidate is never a pass. The three ecosystem proposers
//! above are untouched by that: they hold a program and an argument vector and
//! plan a command.
