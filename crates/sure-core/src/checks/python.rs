//! The checks a Python project's declared tools turn into.
//!
//! `P4-T003`'s acceptance, and it is one sentence:
//!
//! > *Declared import/test/lint/type checks use available tools without silent
//! > package installation.*
//!
//! # The four words, and the role that is not a role
//!
//! Three of the four are [`CommandRole`]s and are checks:
//! [`Test`](CommandRole::Test), [`Lint`](CommandRole::Lint) and
//! [`TypeCheck`](CommandRole::TypeCheck). The fourth is read as
//! [`Install`](CommandRole::Install), and the evidence for that reading is in
//! the sentence itself: the half that gives this task its teeth is about package
//! installation, and `CommandRole::ALL` opens with exactly these four in exactly
//! this order. Whatever the word was meant to be, **installing is what the
//! sentence is about**, and [`InstallStep`] is where this module answers for it.
//!
//! **`import` is not a [`CommandRole`], and SURE proposes no import check.** The
//! conventional smoke check in a Python CI job is `python -c "import pkg"`, and
//! SURE cannot build it from anything a manifest declares: the import name is
//! not the distribution name — `PyYAML` imports as `yaml` and `scikit-learn` as
//! `sklearn` — so an import check derived from `[project] name` would be a
//! command that fails for a large fraction of the projects it was built for, and
//! deriving the mapping would be SURE inventing a convention and then running a
//! command on the strength of it. That is the same line
//! [`discover::node`](crate::discover::node)'s script matching holds to when it
//! refuses to read `test:unit` as `test`, and it is stated here rather than left
//! as a missing row.
//!
//! # What the module adds that `super::node` did not have to
//!
//! **Installing is planned and is never a check.** [`InstallStep`] is a separate
//! type, and the separation is the whole of *without silent package
//! installation*: no [`CheckProposal`] this module builds names
//! [`ActionKind::InstallDependencies`], and
//! `nothing_this_module_proposes_installs_anything` holds that over every role
//! rather than over the ones somebody thought of. Where node's acceptance was
//! about which mode may run a check, this one is about a step that is not a
//! check at all — and the failure it is arranged against is not a wrong verdict
//! but an **unrequested change to the machine**. A caller that schedules the
//! proposals and never asks for [`PythonChecks::install`] has a plan that runs
//! tools which may not be installed, and the outcome of that is a check that
//! *fails* — visibly, with the tool's own error — rather than a package SURE
//! put on the user's disk without being asked.
//!
//! **The interpreter is a question no other ecosystem asks.** Node's runner is a
//! package manager and `Managers::agreed` answering `None` means SURE cannot
//! spell a command. For Python it is worse than that: `command_for` has an
//! answer for `None` — `python -m <tool>` — and that answer is *the wrong
//! interpreter* when the project has already named two. See [`Runner`].
//!
//! **A declaration SURE could not read is not a declaration that is not there.**
//! Poetry's table form puts a real dependency in
//! [`PyProject::dependencies_not_text`](crate::discover::python::PyProject::dependencies_not_text)
//! instead of in the dependency list, so it never reaches `TOOLS` and the
//! project looks like one that declares no linter. [`MissingKind::NotReadable`]
//! is the fourth way a project can leave SURE without a command, and it exists
//! because of this ecosystem.
//!
//! # What it does not do
//!
//! **It does not look at the installed environment.** Nothing here can tell
//! whether a declared tool is *installed*, so a `[tool.poetry]` table naming
//! pytest proposes `poetry run pytest` whether or not `poetry install` has ever
//! been run in this checkout. That is not an oversight: whether the tool is
//! importable is a fact about this machine and the interpreter, it is discovered
//! by running the command, and the run is the check. It is the same limit
//! [`super::node`] states about `node_modules`.
//!
//! **It cannot promise that a runner does not install.** A check command is
//! built by [`command_for`] out of the installer and a name from SURE's own
//! table, and what that command does *inside* the runner is the runner's
//! business — several of them do environment work before running, and which ones
//! and in which version is not something a manifest says. SURE cannot confirm it
//! and does not claim it; what it does instead is carry the exact line in
//! [`CheckReason::DeclaredCommand`] so that the consent prompt shows what would
//! run, and never compose an install of its own.
//!
//! **It does not read a workspace.** `discover::python` reads one project's
//! manifest set and does not walk members, so unlike [`super::node`] there is
//! one component here and not one per member.
//!
//! **It is not the plan.** No check here has been ordered, deduplicated or
//! gated by a mode; that is [`crate::schedule`]'s work and
//! `tests/python_checks.rs` is where the two are put together.
//!
//! # A check is planned as work, and not only as a line
//!
//! Since `P18-T003` every check here is a proposal **and the operation that
//! would carry it out** ([`PlannedWork`](crate::planned_work::PlannedWork)): the
//! program is the installer's own name or `python`, the arguments are `run` and
//! the tool from [`TOOLS`](crate::discover::python::TOOLS), and the directory is
//! the project root.
//!
//! **The rendered line stays a rendering.**
//! [`CheckReason::DeclaredCommand`] still carries `uv run pytest`, because that
//! is what a report prints and what a person is being asked to allow — and
//! nothing reads it back into a program. The line and the vector are one value
//! seen twice: they both come from the discovery's
//! [`invocation_for`](crate::discover::python::invocation_for), which is also
//! what [`command_for`](crate::discover::python::command_for) renders, so a check
//! cannot be shown one command and started with another.
//!
//! **The installer's name is not rewritten for the platform**, and neither is
//! `python`. On Windows a bare `uv` is a name Windows completes with `.exe` and
//! nothing else, so a project whose only installer is installed as `uv.exe` is
//! planned as a command this build will not start; whether a name is startable is
//! [`ProgramPath`](crate::planned_work::ProgramPath)'s answer and the runner's to
//! act on. Appending `.exe` — or wrapping the name in `cmd.exe /c` — would be
//! constructing the interpreter ADR 0014 says SURE must not build.
//!
//! **`python` is the one program SURE names that the project did not.** It is
//! already how [`command_for`] has always spelled the no-installer case, and the
//! reasons [`Runner`] gives for that are the reasons it is spelled here too: a
//! bare tool name would depend on which interpreter is first on the path, which
//! is the fact SURE cannot see and does not claim.
