//! The project as a graph of components, built from what discovery read.
//!
//! Step 1 of `docs/architecture/CHECK_PIPELINE.md` says *"Discover
//! project/workspace, stacks, **components**, declared commands, config
//! references and support level."* [`crate::discover`] is the reading half of
//! that — what each manifest says. This module is the structuring half: **one
//! list of the places in a project that are a thing in their own right**, so
//! that a monorepo is represented as the several components it is rather than as
//! one project with some directories in it.
//!
//! `docs/architecture/COMPONENT_GRAPH.md` is the authority for the rules here.
//!
//! # The rule everything here is arranged around
//!
//! **A component SURE did not read a manifest at does not have a stack.** It has
//! an inference, or it has nothing, and the type says which. There is no
//! `stack: Option<Something>` a caller could render as "no stack", and no plain
//! value a caller could render as a fact.
//!
//! The temptation this is built against is the one that makes a graph look tidy:
//! a member directory whose `package.json` SURE did not open is not a component
//! with an unknown framework, it is **a directory a workspace declaration named
//! and SURE knows nothing else about** — and a reader told the first thing will
//! go looking for a framework that was never claimed.
//!
//! # Why the readings are kept per ecosystem
//!
//! [`Component::manifests`] holds one [`ComponentManifest`] per ecosystem at
//! that component rather than one merged verdict. A merge is where a bug would
//! live: Node and Rust can name the same directory, one of them read a manifest
//! and the other did not, and a single field would have to pick — losing a fact,
//! in one direction or the other, silently. Keeping both means there is no merge
//! to get wrong, and [`Component::stack`] is a *derivation* over the list rather
//! than a stored summary that could drift from it.
//!
//! # What it does not do
//!
//! **It does not resolve dependencies between components.** A `package.json`
//! saying `"@app/ui": "workspace:*"` is a request to a resolver SURE has not
//! run, and drawing that as an edge would be asserting the resolution. What is
//! here is *containment*, which is a fact about the paths in the walk, and
//! *declaration*, which is a fact about a file SURE read and which carries its
//! [`Source`].
//!
//! **It does not read anything.** It is a view over a [`Discovery`] and opens no
//! file, so it cannot disagree with the discovery it came from about what was in
//! the project.
//!
//! **It does not decide what kind of thing a component is.** An application, a
//! library and a service are not distinguishable from a manifest SURE has read,
//! and a guess about which one a directory is would be exactly the inference
//! this module refuses to promote.
