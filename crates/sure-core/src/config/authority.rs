//! Which layer of configuration a setting came from, and what a lower layer is
//! allowed to do with it.
//!
//! # The order, and the one rule
//!
//! `docs/architecture/CONFIG_AUTHORITY.md` puts the user above the project,
//! because the project being checked may be controlled by the same AI whose work
//! SURE is evaluating. This module is that order, and the rule that follows from
//! it:
//!
//! > A layer cannot widen what a layer above it allows, and cannot weaken a
//! > restriction a layer above it imposed.
//!
//! # Why this is not a merge
//!
//! The obvious shape — fold the project's settings into the user's, field by
//! field, keeping whichever is safer — was rejected in ADR 0011, and it is worth
//! restating here because it is the thing a reader expects to find. A merge
//! reinterprets intent: a user who did not mention a setting has not expressed a
//! preference to be maximised, and the merged result cannot be reported back to
//! them in terms of the files they wrote. So there is no `Authority::effective()
//! -> Config`.
//!
//! What there is instead is three answers that *are* well defined:
//!
//! 1. [`Authority::privileges`] — every behaviour any layer asked for, and who,
//!    if anyone, was able to grant it. A project file that asks for network
//!    access produces a recorded refusal, not a granted permission and not
//!    silence.
//! 2. [`Authority::protection`] and [`Authority::privacy_mode`] — restrictions,
//!    where the answer is the stricter of the two layers, because taking the
//!    stricter restriction never turns a statement into a permission.
//! 3. [`Authority::execution`] — the mode in force and the permissions the
//!    configuration grants, as one value. The mode is the user's own and a
//!    project file cannot move it in either direction; a fuller statement of the
//!    rule, and of why "the stricter of the two" is not available for it, is on
//!    [`Authority::execution_mode`].
//!
//! What is left of a project file is read from the project's own settings: the
//! project is the authority on which of its own checks apply, what its own goal
//! is, and how its own components fit together. `Config::scope_reductions` is
//! read that way, and it is *reported* rather than overridden — a project
//! turning a check off cannot be told apart from one that never mentioned it when
//! the value it names is the default, so a claim that the user's file overrode
//! it would be a claim SURE cannot support.
//!
//! # The highest authority is not a file
//!
//! Rank 1 in `CONFIG_AUTHORITY.md` is the person at the keyboard approving the
//! current action. That is not configuration and does not live here:
//! `ConsentGrantor::InteractiveUser` is where it is recorded, and
//! `docs/architecture/CLI.md` reserves status 4 for a decision that comes out of
//! it. When that exists it is applied *on top of* this, which is why
//! [`Authority::permissions`] says what the configuration grants rather than what
//! may happen.
