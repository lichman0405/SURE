//! `sure.yaml`: what a project asks SURE to do.
//!
//! A parsed [`Config`] is **a request, not a grant**. The file it comes from is
//! controlled by the project being checked, which may be controlled by the same
//! AI whose work is under evaluation, so `docs/architecture/CONFIG_AUTHORITY.md`
//! treats it as untrusted input. This module's job is to read it truthfully:
//! every setting that would widen what SURE may do is reported by
//! [`Config::requested_privileges`], and the authority layer resolves those
//! against the user's own configuration before any of them takes effect.
//!
//! Three properties hold here, and each is covered by tests:
//!
//! 1. **An invalid file stops the run.** There is no fallback to defaults. A
//!    file SURE could not understand is not the same as a file that was absent,
//!    and quietly using defaults would apply settings the user did not choose.
//! 2. **Nothing is silently dropped.** Unknown settings and contradictory ones
//!    are errors, because a setting that was ignored looks exactly like one that
//!    was applied.
//! 3. **No credential passes through.** The model has no field that accepts
//!    one, a credential-shaped key stops the read, and any value that reaches a
//!    message is redacted first.
