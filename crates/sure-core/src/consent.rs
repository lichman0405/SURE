//! Which permissions a planned command needs, why, and what a refused command becomes.
//!
//! `P3-T005` acceptance: *"Check plan can explain which commands need permission
//! and why."* and *"Denied command becomes skipped/not checked, never pass."*
//!
//! # What was missing, and what this fills
//!
//! Three pieces existed and did not meet. [`crate::safety`] reads a command line
//! and answers with the categories it may fall into. The domain's
//! [`decide`](sure_domain::execution::decide) answers whether an
//! [`ActionKind`](sure_domain::execution::ActionKind) may proceed under a mode
//! and a permission set — but it takes an `ActionKind`, which is a *named
//! activity* rather than a command, so a caller holding a command line had
//! nothing to hand it. And [`CheckPlan`] records which checks will run, with
//! `excluded` for the ones that will not, but nothing moved a check between
//! those two lists.
//!
//! This module is the join. [`PlannedCommand::new`] takes the same
//! program-and-argument-vector pair the classifier takes, works out **which
//! permissions the command needs and which category required each one**,
//! decides, and — when the answer is not "allowed" — carries the
//! [`NotCheckedReason`] the check will be reported under.
//!
//! # The three rules, and where each comes from
//!
//! 1. **Every permission a command needs must be granted.** A command that
//!    installs *and* reaches the network needs both, and granting one of them
//!    does not carry the other. This is `ExecutionPermissions`' own rule — six
//!    independent permissions — applied to a command that needs more than one.
//! 2. **A category no permission covers is never covered by a grant.**
//!    [`CommandClass::Destructive`] answers `None` to `required_permission`, so
//!    no set of permissions can satisfy it: it needs its own approval, naming
//!    the exact command. `ADR 0009` already states this rule for arbitrary
//!    commands — *"an arbitrary command always requires its own approval in
//!    every mode"* — and this is the same rule for the other thing SURE cannot
//!    bound. It is `P3-T006`'s to *grant*, not this module's; here it is
//!    reported, and [`PlannedCommand::ungrantable`] is where a caller reads which
//!    category it was.
//! 3. **The mode is consulted last, and only for a command that runs code.** The
//!    order is [`decide`](sure_domain::execution::decide)'s own order, and it
//!    decides which of two answers a user gets: a missing permission is
//!    [`ExecutionDecision::Denied`] — SURE is not going to ask — while a mode
//!    that is too cautious is [`ExecutionDecision::NeedsConsent`], because there
//!    is a question to ask and the user can answer it.
//!
//! Rule 3's predicate is [`runs_project_code`], which is true of a set holding
//! [`CommandClass::DynamicHost`] **or** [`CommandClass::Install`] — and the
//! second half of that is the finding this task produced. Installing runs code:
//! npm runs a package's `preinstall`, `install`, `postinstall` and `prepare`
//! around an install, and a source distribution is built by a backend the
//! package brought with it. A rule that consulted the mode only for
//! `DynamicHost` would answer **allowed** for `cargo add serde` in a mode that
//! runs nothing, whenever the install and network permissions happened to be
//! granted — which is exactly what `decide` answers `NeedsConsent` for, and
//! exactly the wrong direction. The test that compares this module against
//! `decide` is what found it.
//!
//! # A refused command is never a pass, and that is structural rather than careful
//!
//! There is no constructor here that turns a command into a [`CheckResult`] with
//! [`CheckStatus::Pass`](sure_domain::status::CheckStatus::Pass).
//! [`PlannedCommand::refusal`] returns `Some` **only** when the decision leaves
//! the check unperformed, and what it returns is [`CheckResult::not_run`] — a
//! `Skipped` result carrying its reason and its weight. A caller that runs an
//! allowed command builds its own result afterwards, from what happened; a caller
//! holding a refused command has nothing to build one from, because no command
//! has run. The plan cannot report a pass for something it did not run, which is
//! the acceptance sentence in the form a reader can check.
//!
//! # Which reason a refusal is reported under
//!
//! **The first permission the command needs that the user has not granted, in
//! [`Permission::ALL`] order** — the vocabulary's own "order shown to a user". A
//! command that needs to install *and* to reach the network reports the install,
//! because the vocabulary lists it first; the full set is on
//! [`PlannedCommand::needs`], and the reason is the headline rather than the
//! list.
//!
//! **The frozen vocabulary has no reason for "this command needs its own approval
//! and has not had it yet", and that case is reported as
//! [`NotCheckedReason::ExecutionNotAuthorized`].** The command is not authorized
//! to execute, which is true whether the obstacle is the mode or the absence of an
//! approval. `UserDeclined` is deliberately not used: nothing has been declined,
//! and a report that said so would be inventing an event — the prompt that can be
//! declined is `P3-T006`'s. `UnknownReason` is not used either: SURE does have a
//! rule here, and it is the vocabulary that is missing a word.
//!
//! # What this does not establish
//!
//! **Nothing about what the command will do when it runs.** [`crate::safety`] says
//! the same thing from its side, and it stays true here: approving `cargo test`
//! approves a command line, not the code behind it.
//!
//! **Nothing about a consent that was actually granted.** This computes what a
//! command needs from the permission set it is handed. Whether the user was asked,
//! what they were shown, and what they answered are
//! [`HostConsent`](sure_domain::execution::HostConsent)'s and `P3-T006`'s, and a
//! test that asserted "the user agreed" from this module's output would be
//! asserting something this module cannot see.
//!
//! **Nothing about ordering, and nothing about how many times a command runs.** A
//! plan is a set of decisions about commands, not a schedule.
//!
//! **Nothing about which checks SURE should have planned.** A plan here is the
//! commands a caller handed over; a command that was never planned cannot be
//! refused by this module, and
//! [`exclude_refused_from`](PermissionPlan::exclude_refused_from) reports that
//! rather than absorbing it.
