//! What kind of project this is, and how SURE knows.
//!
//! This is step 1 of `docs/architecture/CHECK_PIPELINE.md`. The filesystem half
//! of it — which files SURE will look at, and which it will not — is
//! [`crate::scan`] and is described by `docs/architecture/PROJECT_DISCOVERY.md`.
//! This module is the other half: **reading a few named files and saying what
//! they claim the project is.** `docs/architecture/ECOSYSTEM_DISCOVERY.md` is
//! the authority for that half — the rule, the limits, and the gaps it does not
//! close — and the table at the end of it maps each statement to the test that
//! holds it.
//!
//! # The one rule everything here is arranged around
//!
//! **A manifest states a request, not a fact.** `"test": "jest"` in
//! `package.json` means the project *declares* that command; it does not mean
//! `jest` is installed, that the script runs, or that any test passes. `"react":
//! "^18"` is a range handed to a resolver, not the version on disk.
//!
//! That distinction is `docs/architecture/EVIDENCE_MODEL.md`'s, and it is why
//! every finding here is shaped the way it is:
//!
//! - A finding names the file it came from. There is no code path that produces
//!   a package manager, a script or a framework without a [`Source`] beside it.
//! - Dependency versions are recorded **verbatim** and never interpreted. SURE
//!   has not run a resolver, so it has nothing to say about what a range
//!   resolves to.
//! - What was *not* found is reported as prominently as what was.
//!   [`node::NodeProject::conventional_scripts`] returns a row for every
//!   conventional script whether or not it is declared, because "there is no
//!   test script" is a finding and silence is not.
//! - The only string a project can put into a finding is one SURE recorded as
//!   data — a script's name, a dependency's name. Every *sentence* is a
//!   constant.
//!
//! # What it does not do
//!
//! **It runs nothing.** No `npm`, no `node`, no resolver, no network. Reading a
//! manifest is not executing a project, and the whole of step 1 is on the
//! inspect-only side of `docs/architecture/EXECUTION_SAFETY.md`.
//!
//! **It does not look at `node_modules`**, and not only because the scan leaves
//! it out. What is installed is `node_modules`'s answer, and a directory that is
//! usually absent, usually stale, and never committed is not a fact about the
//! project a person can act on.
//!
//! **It does not decide whether the project is good.** It says what the project
//! declares and at what support level; whether the declaration is honest is what
//! the checks after it are for.
//!
//! **It is not the diagnostics module.** [`crate::diagnostics`] is what SURE
//! says about *its own* work and is explicitly never evidence about the project.
//! A manifest SURE could not parse is a finding about the *project*, so it is a
//! [`Unread`] in the result rather than a log line — the two are separate types
//! for the same reason [`crate::diagnostics`] gives.
