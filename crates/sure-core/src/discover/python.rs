//! What a Python project declares about itself.
//!
//! See [`super`] for the rule this is all arranged around: **a manifest states a
//! request, not a fact.** Nothing here runs `pip`, `uv` or `python`, resolves a
//! version, imports anything, or opens a virtual environment.
//!
//! # The files it reads, and why those
//!
//! | File | What it answers |
//! |---|---|
//! | `pyproject.toml` | the whole of what a modern project declares — PEP 621, Poetry, PDM and uv all put it here |
//! | `Pipfile` | what pipenv projects declare, in TOML, under the same accessors |
//! | `requirements*.txt` | dependencies declared as a flat list, the older way |
//! | `setup.py`, `setup.cfg` | that this is a Python project, and that SURE cannot read what it declares |
//! | `poetry.lock`, `uv.lock`, `Pipfile.lock`, `pdm.lock` | which installer has run here |
//! | `.python-version` | the interpreter the project asks for |
//!
//! A lockfile is **not parsed**, for the reason [`super::node`] gives and one of
//! its own: a Python lockfile is not a single format. `poetry.lock` is TOML,
//! `uv.lock` is TOML with a different schema, `Pipfile.lock` is JSON, and
//! `pdm.lock` is TOML again. What is wanted from all four is one bit — *this
//! project has a `uv.lock`* — and that bit is the file's existence, which is
//! also why the manifest byte budget is never spent on one.
//!
//! # Why `setup.py` is never read
//!
//! **`setup.py` is a Python program.** Everything it declares is the result of
//! running it: `install_requires=[x for x in ...]`, a version read from a file,
//! a dependency list fetched from the network. There is no reading it that is
//! not running it, and SURE does not run a project to find out what it is. So
//! its presence says *this project declares itself in code SURE will not
//! execute*, which is a finding, and `setup.cfg` is left unread for a smaller
//! reason with the same shape: it is INI, no INI parser is in this workspace's
//! dependency set, and a hand-rolled one could silently mis-parse — the reason
//! `docs/architecture/RUST_DESIGN.md` gives for using real parsers everywhere
//! else. Both are recorded as what they are rather than reported as absence.
//!
//! # Why the installer is not simply "the one with a lockfile"
//!
//! The same argument [`super::node`] makes, and it lands differently here
//! because Python's evidence is different in kind:
//!
//! - **declared** — a `[tool.<installer>]` table, or a `Pipfile` for pipenv.
//!   The project's own statement about itself.
//! - **locked** — that installer's lockfile exists.
//! - **requirements** — a `requirements*.txt` exists.
//!
//! The third is the interesting one, and it is **the weakest evidence in the
//! whole module**, weaker than Node's `engines` hint: `uv pip install -r
//! requirements.txt`, `poetry export`, `pdm export` and pip all consume that same
//! file, so its existence says *something installs from a requirements file* and
//! does not say which. It therefore never creates a disagreement, and it decides
//! [`Managers::agreed`] only when nothing stronger was found. A project with both
//! `requirements.txt` and `uv.lock` is not contradicting itself — that is the
//! normal shape of a project that moved to uv and kept the file its deployment
//! reads — and reporting it as a contradiction would be a false alarm of exactly
//! the kind that trains a reader to ignore the real one.
//!
//! # Why the tool table is fixed
//!
//! Same reason as [`super::node`]: package names live in the project's manifest,
//! so every tool this module reports comes from [`TOOLS`] and the value stored is
//! the table's own `&'static str`. A dependency that is not in the table is not
//! reported at all.
//!
//! # The one thing here that is SURE's construction rather than the project's
//!
//! [`command_for`] returns a command SURE built — `uv run pytest` — and Node's
//! [`super::node::Package::command_for`] returns one built from a script the
//! *project* wrote. The difference matters and is why this module names its
//! type [`ConventionalCommand`] rather than reusing Node's
//! [`super::node::ConventionalScript`]: **the command is a plan, and it is never
//! evidence about the project.** A plan is only offered for a role the project
//! declared the tool for, and the tools behind it are named in
//! [`ConventionalCommand::because`] so a reader can see what the plan rests on.
//!
//! **The plan and the line are one value seen twice.** Since `P18-T003`
//! [`invocation_for`] answers the plan as an [`Invocation`] — a program and its
//! argument vector — and [`command_for`] renders that plan for a person to read.
//! Nothing is spelled twice and nothing is parsed: a caller that means to *start*
//! a check takes the vector, and a report takes the rendering, so the two cannot
//! describe different things.
