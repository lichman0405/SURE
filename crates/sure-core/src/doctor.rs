//! What SURE can say about its own installation on this machine.
//!
//! `sure doctor` is the command; this module is the facts. How they are worded
//! is the CLI's, per `docs/adr/0001-*` — nothing here produces a sentence a user
//! reads.
//!
//! # What this is for
//!
//! `docs/architecture/STORAGE_AND_DATA_PATHS.md` requires the CLI to expose the
//! exact paths SURE keeps things in, "so users can see/delete what is stored",
//! and `docs/product/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` requires `sure doctor` to give
//! actionable environment information. Both are questions about SURE's own
//! installation rather than about a project, which is why nothing here reads a
//! project, and why `Store::open_at` rather than `Store::open` is the entry
//! point used below.
//!
//! # Three things this deliberately does not do
//!
//! **It does not read the settings file.** It reports the path and whether
//! something is there. `docs/architecture/DIAGNOSTICS.md` requires that a secret
//! never have to be handled in order to be reported, and the way to keep that
//! true is for the diagnostic never to open the file that may hold one. Reading
//! settings back is not implemented in this build — `sure config show` refuses,
//! which is where that question belongs. There
//! is a test in `tests/doctor.rs` that reads this file and fails if it grows a
//! reference to the settings module.
//!
//! **It does not create the store.** A store that does not exist is reported as
//! nothing recorded yet. A diagnostic that changes what it is diagnosing is
//! worse than one that says it did not look, and a `doctor` run that left a
//! database behind would do exactly that.
//!
//! **It does not run a program.** Finding a program on `PATH` is an observed
//! fact about the filesystem; running it is a different claim. SURE does have a
//! process runner — `P3-T001`'s, in `crate::process` — and this module
//! deliberately does not reach it: a command whose output a user pastes into a
//! bug report should not be a command that starts something. Everything a
//! program check here establishes is repeated in [`NotChecked`], so a reader
//! cannot mistake the one for the other.
//!
//! # It does not become evidence
//!
//! Nothing here produces a [`CheckResult`](crate::status::CheckResult) or a
//! `Finding`. Every value is `observed_fact` about this machine at this moment
//! and none of it is a statement about a project.
