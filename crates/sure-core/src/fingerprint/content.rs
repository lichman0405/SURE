//! Fingerprinting a project that is not under version control, by reading it.
//!
//! This is the other kind, and the one that needs nothing but the project
//! itself: no Git, no repository, no history. It walks the project and hashes
//! what it finds.
//!
//! # What it is for
//!
//! [`crate::fingerprint::git_fingerprint`] gets its precision from Git — Git
//! knows which tracked files differ from `HEAD`, so SURE does not have to read
//! them to find out. A project with no repository has no such answer available,
//! and a manifest over its files is the only thing that can be computed. It is
//! more expensive than the Git kind and covers strictly more: every readable
//! file, not only the changed ones.
//!
//! It is also the escape hatch for a project that **is** in a repository and
//! should not be fingerprinted by it. There are two such cases, and they are
//! named in [`crate::fingerprint::project_fingerprint`], which is where the
//! choice between the kinds is made.
//!
//! # The rules it inherits rather than restates
//!
//! The coverage rule is the same one: **a file is part of the fingerprint if and
//! only if a check could read it.** The walk is [`crate::scan`] — the same
//! tables, the same comparison, the same limits — so "generated and vendored
//! churn is excluded" is not a claim made here and checked somewhere else; it is
//! the same decision, made once. `node_modules`, `target/`, `vendor/`, `dist/`,
//! `__pycache__` and SURE's own `.sure/` are out for the reason the scan records
//! beside each of them.
//!
//! What is at each path is [`crate::fingerprint::read`]'s answer, the same one
//! the Git kind uses. A link means the same thing in both, and a pipe is
//! described and never opened in both, because it is one implementation rather
//! than two that agree today.
//!
//! # A link is in the manifest, and the scan did not put it there
//!
//! The scan skips links — [`SkipReason::NotFollowed`] — because a check does not
//! read through one, and it reports the skip as a **loss** because a link could
//! have been hiding project content. This module does not treat it as a loss: it
//! resolves the skip into the same [`Contents::Link`] the Git kind records.
//!
//! Leaving it out would be the dangerous direction. A link is a path in the
//! project and its target is the whole of what it is, so retargeting one is a
//! change to the project; a manifest that ignored links would keep the same
//! digest through that change and report evidence about the old state as current
//! for the new one. The Git kind already refuses to make that mistake — a
//! tracked link is recorded by its target even though nothing reads through it —
//! and this is the same decision.
//!
//! Every other loss the walk reports **is** a loss here: a directory that could
//! not be listed, a level the depth limit stopped, the point the entry budget
//! ran out, a file that could not be read, a pipe met inside a directory. Those
//! all mean the manifest would describe part of the project while reading like a
//! description of the whole of it, so they are [`FingerprintError::IncompleteTree`]
//! rather than a shorter digest.
//!
//! [`SkipReason::NotFollowed`]: crate::scan::SkipReason::NotFollowed
//! [`Contents::Link`]: crate::fingerprint::read::Contents
