//! What is at a path, described in a way a digest can use.
//!
//! This is the part of fingerprinting that does not depend on how the paths were
//! found, and it is shared by both kinds for that reason. Git names the paths
//! that matter and the content manifest walks for them; everything after that —
//! opening the file, hashing it, deciding what a link means, what to do about a
//! pipe, spending the budget — is one implementation.
//!
//! # Why it is shared rather than written twice
//!
//! Two implementations of "what is at this path" would be two answers to a
//! question that has one, and the way they would diverge is not symmetric. A
//! link recorded by its target in one place and by nothing in the other would
//! make a project state that is one state into two — the harmless direction —
//! only until the reverse happens, and then a link retargeted to somewhere else
//! would leave the fingerprint where it was. That is a change nothing noticed,
//! which is the failure this product exists to prevent.
//!
//! The same argument already holds `crate::scan` and the nested-directory walk
//! together; this module is that decision applied one level further up.
//!
//! # The two rules that are decided here rather than by a caller
//!
//! **A link is recorded by its target and never read through.** Reading through
//! one would read whatever it names, including outside the project, and every
//! other part of SURE refuses to do that. The target as text is also the whole
//! of what a link is: a link retargeted to a different file is a different link
//! whatever is at the other end.
//!
//! **Something that is neither a file, a directory nor a link is described and
//! never opened.** `File::open` on a FIFO with no writer blocks until a writer
//! appears, and the working tree is written by whoever SURE is checking — a
//! project could otherwise hang a check with no output, and a check that never
//! returns cannot be told apart from one that is still working. What is recorded
//! is the kind, because a file replaced by a pipe is a change and a pipe
//! replaced by a socket is a change, and recording both as "nothing" would make
//! them one state.
