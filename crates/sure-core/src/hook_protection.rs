//! Protection decision adapter for harness pre-action hooks.
//!
//! Maps harness tool requests to [`ExecutionDecision`] using the existing
//! domain machinery rather than inventing a new rule engine.
//!
//! P11-T006: Cursor protection where supported.
//!
//! # Where the protection mode's rule lives
//!
//! `docs/security/PROTECTION_MODE.md` gives the user three modes and one
//! difference between the first two: **strict** additionally asks before
//! migrations, CI/CD configuration, secret/config areas and broad filesystem
//! modifications. Until `P13-T004` the mode was parsed, validated and ranked
//! (`crate::config::ProtectionMode`, `Authority::protection`) and read by
//! nothing, so `standard` and `strict` were two names for one behaviour.
//!
//! The rule is **here**, beside the engine that already turns a request into an
//! action, and it is a second question asked of the same decision rather than a
//! second decision path: [`decide`] answers first with the execution mode and
//! permissions, and only an [`ExecutionDecision::Allowed`] is then put to the
//! mode. A refusal the domain reached is never diluted by a mode — strict adds
//! a question, it does not replace an answer.
//!
//! What the second question may look at is deliberately narrow, and since
//! `P13-T005` it is two things rather than one.
//!
//! What is classified is the path the normalised event carries — the argument
//! the harness itself says the tool is aimed at — and only for the three action
//! kinds that name one file. That rule is `P13-T004`'s and it is unchanged.
//!
//! Beside it, a **command line the harness claims** is read, for one purpose
//! and with one reader: [`crate::safety::read_simple_command`], which refuses
//! any text whose meaning is not the characters in it and answers `None` rather
//! than a guess. This module reads the harness's own `args.command` — the
//! string the harness says it is about to run — and puts it to
//! [`crate::safety::classify`], the one classifier, exactly as `P3-T004` puts a
//! program and an argument vector to it. Nothing here is a second table of
//! dangerous commands and nothing here decides anything: the reading can only
//! *name* a danger in a request that was already held, and a name never lets
//! one through. The one thing a name changes is that an allowance the user
//! recorded can be spent on it (see below).
//!
//! A command line SURE declines to read is not a gap to be filled: the request
//! keeps the answer it would have had before, which for a shell tool is a
//! refusal, and the sentence says nothing about what the command would do.
//!
//! # The three dangers, and the one-time allowance
//!
//! Three dangerous acts are named: a **broad delete**, a **force push** and a
//! **sensitive read** ([`Danger`]). Each is read off an answer the code below
//! already reaches — the classifier's own `Source::Rule` and `Destructive`
//! class for the first two, and strict mode's credential rule for the third —
//! so there is one answer to *what would this do* and the danger is a reading
//! of it rather than a rule beside it.
//!
//! A user who has been shown one of these can record, with
//! `sure hook allow-once`, that SURE would let **one** matching request
//! through, once. The record is the durable half: a hook is a fresh process per
//! event, so a one-time grant cannot live in memory, and
//! `crate::allowance` states what is stored and [`Store::spend_allowance`]
//! states how it is spent atomically.
//!
//! [`Store::spend_allowance`]: crate::store::Store::spend_allowance
//!
//! **This is a statement about what SURE would do.** Both integrations are
//! Observed (Tier 1), so nothing here establishes that a harness honours an
//! allowance any more than it establishes that a harness honours a block. The
//! sentence an allowance produces says *SURE would let this through*, and the
//! limit is the same one every other answer in this module has.
//!
//! Since `P13-T010` the writer reads the settings as well as the words, because
//! a grant is only worth recording where an act can be named at all: an act is
//! named for a request SURE *holds*, a hold depends on the execution and
//! protection settings in force, and a grant recorded under settings that hold
//! nothing is one no request can ever spend. The question is asked **of the tool
//! the user named**, because a grant is spent by a request that matches the tool
//! and the words: [`acts_a_tool_could_be_held_for`] answers which acts a request
//! naming one tool can reach, [`acts_a_request_could_be_held_for`] is the same
//! question unioned over every tool, and
//! [`allowance_could_not_be_spent_reason`] is the sentence the writer refuses
//! with when the answer for the named tool is none. Both are questions put to
//! [`assess_request`] rather than a second rule beside it, so what a user is told
//! cannot drift from the rule that would answer their request.
//!
//! Two readings of the settings, both measured rather than argued. A tool name
//! a harness's vocabulary *claims* is read in that vocabulary and in no other,
//! which is why `Edit` is a change to a project file rather than an arbitrary
//! command; a name no vocabulary claims is the arbitrary command it may be. And
//! a refusal about a tool whose action needs a permission **no** setting in this
//! build can grant is a refusal that names no setting at all, because naming one
//! would be naming a change that would not help:
//! [`an_action_no_setting_can_grant_reason`] asks the vocabularies whether any
//! mode or any request grants that permission rather than asserting the answer
//! in prose, so a later release that makes a change grantable changes the
//! sentence with it. The *subject* is still unread at write time, for the reason
//! `PROTECTION_MODE.md` gives.
//!
//! # Capability tier honesty
//!
//! Both integrations are **Observed** (Tier 1) and neither can confirm the
//! harness honours the answer, so what SURE has is a decision about what it
//! would do, not a record of what the harness did. That is why a reason says
//! *SURE does not allow it* rather than *it did not happen*: nothing in this
//! build can establish the second sentence.
