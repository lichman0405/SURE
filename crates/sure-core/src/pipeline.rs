//! The check pipeline: from a project directory to a verdict.
//!
//! `docs/architecture/CHECK_PIPELINE.md` names twelve stages, and this module is
//! the thing that runs them, in that order, for one project. **It implements no
//! stage.** Every stage is a call into a module an earlier phase built and
//! tested — [`crate::discover`], [`crate::project_intent`] and
//! [`crate::intent_model`], [`crate::fingerprint`], [`crate::schedule`],
//! [`crate::checks`] and [`crate::runtime_probes`], the five completeness
//! scanners, [`crate::analysis_provider`], [`crate::claim_checker`],
//! [`crate::aggregation`], [`crate::coverage_summary`],
//! [`crate::project_verdict`] and [`crate::recheck_lifecycle`] — and composed
//! through [`crate::false_completion_aggregator`]. What is written here is the
//! sequencing, the per-stage record, and the rule that decides what all of it
//! means together.
//!
//! # The rule this module exists to keep
//!
//! **A stage that did not run is never a stage that passed.** Every one of the
//! twelve stages gets a [`StageRecord`], and a stage that had work and did not do
//! it takes one of three forms, none of which is silence:
//!
//! - [`StageOutcome::NotPartOfWork`] — this run does not ask for the stage. A
//!   `sure check` produces no repair contract, and a stage SURE was never asked
//!   to perform is not a stage that failed to run.
//! - [`StageOutcome::NotRun`] — the stage had work to do and did not do it, with
//!   the reason the domain's own vocabulary gives where the vocabulary has a word
//!   for it. Every such stage also contributes a [`CheckResult`] to the
//!   aggregate, so the verdict is degraded by the gap rather than merely
//!   accompanied by a note about it.
//! - [`StageOutcome::Unfinished`] — the stage tried and could not finish. The run
//!   has no verdict at all, and [`PipelineOutcome::run`] is `None`.
//!
//! [`PipelineOutcome::is_green`] asks two questions and requires both: the
//! verdict permits hand-off by [`ProjectVerdict`]'s own rule, **and** no stage in
//! this run's range is anything other than [`StageOutcome::Ran`]. The second is
//! not a restatement of the first — a stage whose gap produced no `CheckResult`,
//! because it had nothing checkable to record a gap against, would be invisible
//! to the aggregate and visible here. A reviewer can see both.
//!
//! # What runs
//!
//! Stage 4 builds three things and not one: the schedule, the [`PermissionPlan`]
//! holding every command the schedule names, and the [`Enforcement`] that applies
//! the execution mode to both. It then hands the schedule and the enforcement to
//! [`run_scheduled_checks`](crate::planned_check_runner::run_scheduled_checks),
//! which is the plan carried out — and that one call is the whole of what stages 5
//! and 6 describe.
//!
//! Its contract is one result per scheduled check, in the plan's order, so that
//! **no check that produced nothing can become green**. A check the plan stopped
//! keeps the plan's own
//! [`not_run`](crate::schedule::ScheduledCheck::not_run); a check the mode
//! admitted whose runner reported nothing is an `Error`; two results for one check
//! is a refusal that stops the run rather than a rule for choosing. Static detector
//! checks carry their own observation and reach no process at all — they are
//! [`CheckOperation::Precomputed`](crate::planned_work::CheckOperation::Precomputed),
//! and the runner reads their result out of the evidence.
//!
//! # The project is read twice, and the second read is the one that matters
//!
//! Stage 3 takes **one** fingerprint, and every result in the run names it. That
//! is a binding on the *value* — [`CheckResult::project_fingerprint`]'s own
//! documentation says a result that names its state exists so that it cannot be
//! read against a later one — and it is not a statement about the world. Every
//! result in a run carries the same fingerprint, so nothing inside the run can
//! ever notice that the project moved; `aggregate_run`'s refusal is a
//! within-run consistency check and would refuse a *correct* answer as readily as
//! a wrong one. **The world is what the second read compares against**, and stage
//! 10 takes it, immediately before the results are added up. A result from a
//! check that ran the project's own code, taken before the project moved, is
//! replaced by one that is not a pass and that says why.
//!
//! **A build's own caches are not a change, and this is measured rather than
//! argued.** The fingerprint covers exactly what a check can read
//! ([`crate::fingerprint`]), so `target/` ([`crate::scan`] ignores it as build
//! output), `node_modules/` (vendored) and SURE's own `.sure/` are outside it: a
//! run whose only writes land in those does not move the fingerprint, so it does
//! not invalidate anything and cannot invalidate itself. The honest limit of that
//! statement is the other half of it, and it is not papered over: a build that
//! writes a file the walk **does** cover — a generated source file, a
//! regenerated lockfile — has genuinely changed the project, and the run that
//! caused it has genuinely invalidated its own evidence. That is not a false
//! stale; it is the first failure in [`crate::fingerprint`]'s two-way list being
//! paid for the sake of the second, which is the worse one.
//!
//! # What a run a user did not grant does
//!
//! **Nothing, and that is a reading rather than a promise.**
//! [`crate::consent::decide_for`] refuses any command that runs the project's code
//! in a mode that does not, so under [`ExecutionSettings::inspect_only`] the
//! enforcement admits no such command and the runner is never reached. The
//! measurement is `tests::a_run_a_user_did_not_grant_starts_nothing` below, which
//! hands this pipeline a runner that records being called and cannot start
//! anything: what it observes is that the recording is empty. The same seam, under
//! a granted authority, observes a run *reaching* the runner — which is why the
//! seam is a field rather than a default nobody can substitute.

//!
//! # The store
//!
//! The pipeline reads a store when it is given one and never opens one itself.
//! That is deliberate: opening a store creates its directory and its file, and a
//! check that created a history in order to report that it had nothing to compare
//! against would be a command changing the thing it is describing. `sure doctor`
//! states the same rule for the same reason.

/// The seed is [`seed_rechecks`], in the module that owns the selection rule, and

/// connects to a service SURE started, under `connect_service`, which is why
/// `ActionKind::BrowserProbe` is deliberately not one of the actions
/// `ActionKind::executes_project_code` lists. That is the right answer to the
/// consent question and the wrong one to this one — a page row's evidence is a
/// page served by the project's own service, so it is about an execution that has
/// ended in exactly the way the service row's is. Reading the consent predicate
/// here **kept a `Pass`** that said a page answered, about a project that had
/// since moved, while withdrawing the `Pass` beside it about the service that
/// served that page: a false green, and the failure this repository treats as
/// worse than a visible error. So this rule asks the question it is about, and
/// stages 5 and 6 go on asking theirs.
///
/// The status is [`CheckStatus::Unknown`] with a reason — not `Warning`, which

/// not `Skipped`, which would read as a decision somebody made when nobody did.
///
/// The result keeps **its own** `project_fingerprint`. That is not an oversight
/// and the alternative is worse in both directions: binding it to the newer state
/// would make `aggregate_run` refuse the whole set and leave the run with no
/// verdict at all, and binding it to the older state is simply true — the run is
