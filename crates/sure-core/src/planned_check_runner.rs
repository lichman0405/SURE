//! The door between a plan and a process.
//!
//! [`crate::planned_work`] carries a check's executable half as named fields, and
//! [`crate::enforce`] decides which of those may run. Neither of them starts
//! anything, and both say so: `CommandSpec` has deliberately no method that turns
//! it into a runner's request, and `AdmittedCommand::new` is private so that the
//! only value carrying a "yes" is one the enforcement produced. This module is the
//! caller those two were written for. It is the first file in the product that can
//! carry a planned command to [`crate::process`], and `tests/spawn_sites.rs` is
//! the census that makes its arrival a deliberate edit rather than a quiet one.
//!
//! # What runs, and what makes that a fact about a type
//!
//! The runner's input is [`AdmittedRun`], and there is no way to build one except
//! [`AdmittedRun::new`], which demands an [`AdmittedCommand`]. That type has a
//! private constructor and is produced by exactly one function, so a check that
//! enforcement did not admit is not *unlikely* to reach the process runner — it is
//! unrepresentable, because there is no value to hand the runner and no way to
//! make one. This is decision 4 of
//! `docs/adr/0014-planned-check-execution-contract.md` stated as a signature
//! rather than as a rule for a reader.
//!
//! Pairing is not a formality either. An admitted command is two things — a
//! program and an argument vector — and so is a [`CommandSpec`], and
//! [`AdmittedRun::new`] refuses unless the check, the program and the arguments
//! all agree. Everything else a spec carries (directory, environment, limits) is
//! not part of what was decided, so it is not part of what is compared; see
//! [`crate::safety::classify`], which is the decision and takes the same two
//! things.
//!
//! # Three kinds of work, one seam, and no test in this file starts a process
//!
//! [`CheckRunner`] is the whole of the machine: a method from an admitted command
//! to a [`CommandRun`], since `P18-T009` a method from an admitted service to the
//! [`CheckResult`] it produced, and since `P18-T010` a method from an admitted
//! browser check to the [`CheckResult`] it produced. [`ProcessRunner`] is the
//! implementation that can start any of them, and it is the only one in this
//! file. Every proof below — that an unadmitted command never arrives, that one
//! check produces one result, that a check which reported nothing becomes an
//! error, that a service gets the environment the plan holds, that a page is
//! opened on the port that answered — is made with a fake that records what it
//! was asked for and answers from a value. **A test that starts a real process is
//! a test that measures this machine rather than this code**, and nothing in this
//! module's acceptance needs one: `tests/process_runner.rs` is where starting a
//! process is the subject, and `tests/runtime_start.rs` is where the window, the
//! question, the look and the stop are.
//!
//! The three methods are on one trait rather than three, and that is the same
//! argument the pipeline's own `runner` field makes: *what may this run start?* is
//! one question with one answer, and three traits would let one run hold three
//! runners that could disagree about it — a fake for commands and the real runner
//! for services, or the other way round.
//!
//! # Exactly one result per scheduled check
//!
//! Rule six of the ADR, in three parts, and this module is where two of them land.
//!
//! - **A check the mode stopped keeps the plan's own stopped result.** Asked
//!   first, of the plan, and then of the enforcement: a check the schedule
//!   decided against is not carried out whatever its operation holds, and a check
//!   the schedule allowed but whose command the mode stopped keeps the result that
//!   command's own refusal carries. Both are `Skipped` and neither can be a pass.
//! - **A check the mode admitted that produced no result becomes an `Error`.** Not
//!   a silence, not a row quietly missing from the run's list, and never a pass.
//!   This is the gap `coverage_summary.rs:75`'s `None => continue` leaves open for
//!   any caller that hands it a set that does not cover the plan: a scheduled check
//!   with no result is a check SURE said it would carry out, and the honest report
//!   of having no observation for it is that SURE's own machinery did not produce
//!   one.
//! - **Two results for one check is an internal error that stops the run**, and so
//!   is the same duplication one step earlier — two commands the enforcement
//!   admitted for one check. There is no honest rule for choosing between two
//!   answers to one question, and inventing one (first wins, least green wins)
//!   would be new run semantics living in a runner.
//!
//! [`crate::aggregation::aggregate_run`] states a rule that looks like the second
//! of those and is not the same one: a set of results that does not cover a check
//! is aggregated as `Unknown` with [`crate::aggregation::NOTHING_CAME_BACK`],
//! because a result *set* that is missing a row is not evidence about why. The two
//! are kept apart on purpose. The runner knows what it was asked to carry out and
//! says so; the aggregator knows only what it was handed, and says only that. The
//! effect of this module's rule is that the aggregator's arm is now rare rather
//! than always — which is what the ADR's consequence note says it should be.
//!
//! # A service check is carried out by the module that already ran one
//!
//! [`CheckOperation::Service`] holds a [`ServiceCheckSpec`], and there is exactly
//! one implementation of what a service check *is* in this tree: the startup
//! window, the one question, the stop on every path, and the verdict table in
//! [`crate::runtime_start`]. So this module's job for a service is pairing and
//! nothing more — the spec the schedule holds, the command the enforcement
//! admitted for that check, and [`StartSmoke::planned`], the constructor
//! `P18-T009` gave that door. A second mapping written here — start, poll, one
//! HTTP call, stop — would be a second answer to *did this service work* that
//! could disagree with the first, and the tests that hold the first are
//! `tests/runtime_start.rs`'s, over real processes.
//!
//! **What this file's tests can hold instead is the wiring**: that a service
//! check's own spec reaches the seam, that the admission is paired by check id
//! and by program and argument vector, and that nothing of the sort happens for a
//! check whose work is not a service. The window, the question and the stop are
//! `runtime_start.rs`'s and are measured there.
//!
//! **The environment is the plan's own, and that is the whole of what this file
//! decides about it.** [`AdmittedService`] carries a [`ServiceCheckSpec`] whose
//! command holds the environment, and `StartSmoke::planned` reads it — so a
//! service check is started with what the plan states rather than with whatever
//! SURE was started with. That is the same rule the command path already follows
//! in [`AdmittedRun::request`], where the spec's environment is the request's;
//! the alternative, a service that inherits SURE's environment because nobody
//! looked, is `service.rs`'s old gap and the accident this clause is about.
//!
//! # A browser check is a service check with something to do while it is up
//!
//! [`CheckOperation::Browser`] holds a [`BrowserCheckSpec`], which holds a
//! [`ServiceCheckSpec`] — and `P18-T010` opened that door by **reusing the
//! service's own lifecycle rather than writing a second one**. The window, the
//! readiness question, the stop on every path and the verdict table are
//! [`crate::runtime_start`]'s and are not restated here; what a browser check adds
//! is one look, taken between the answer and the stop, and
//! [`crate::runtime_start::StartSmoke::run_then`] is the caller's own step that
//! exists for it.
//!
//! **The look is gated on the service answering, and the gate is the answer
//! rather than the verdict.** [`StartSmoke::run_then`] calls the step only when
//! the readiness question came back as an answer — any status, including a 404 —
//! because a project whose readiness path is `/health` and whose page is at
//! `/post/1` is the ordinary shape (see `planned_work.rs`'s own fixture), and a
//! service that answered *something* is a service whose page can be opened. A
//! service that was never reached produces no look at all, which is what clause
//! one of `P18-T010` says.
//!
//! **The stop happens whether the look passed, failed or panicked**, and that is
//! [`crate::runtime_start`]'s property rather than this module's to restate:
//! `run_then` takes the same `?`-free path to the stop that `run` does, and the
//! `Drop` on the service's own stopper covers the panic. What this module decides
//! is only *what to look at and with what*.
//!
//! **The driver is held, not built.** [`ProcessRunner`] holds a
//! [`browser::Driver`] — an alias for the interface, declared in
//! [`crate::browser`] so that this file names a name rather than the adapter —
//! and a runner that was given none answers a browser check with an `Error`
//! saying so. That is deliberate and it is the property to keep: **un-wiring the
//! driver turns a browser check into a failure of SURE's own check, never into a
//! pass and never into a skip.** The file that constructs a driver is
//! `sure-cli/src/check.rs`, the composition root where `sure check` binds every
//! implementation it uses; nothing in this crate builds one.
//!
//! # What this module does not do
//!
//! **It does not decide what may run.** Every "yes" comes from
//! [`Enforcement::admitted`], and a caller holding every command the plan
//! considered has nothing it can do with them here.
//!
//! **It decides no verdict for a browser.** A driver reports what the page did
//! and [`crate::browser::Report::verdict`] says what that is worth; this file
//! calls the second on the first and adds nothing. A browser check whose driver
//! was absent is the one exception, and it is an `Error` for the reason above
//! rather than a verdict about the project.
//!
//! **It builds no command line.** The one translation here is field for field, and
//! an argument holding a space is one argument before it and one argument after it.
