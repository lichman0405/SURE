//! Executable work, typed at the moment a check is proposed.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! The plan has always said *what* a run intends to check and never *what
//! running one is*. `checks::node::NodeChecks::of` asks its discovery for a
//! rendered line — `npm run build` — and files it in
//! [`CheckReason::DeclaredCommand`](crate::schedule::CheckReason), which is
//! display text: it is what a report prints. From that point the only
//! description of the work is the sentence a person reads, and the shortest
//! way to execute it — split the string, start the pieces — is the act
//! `docs/architecture/EXECUTION_SAFETY.md` and the repository's invariants
//! forbid. A string that a report prints must never become the reason a
//! program runs.
//!
//! So the work is a value here, and it is a value **before** anything decides
//! whether it may run: [`PlannedWork`] holds a check's proposal and the
//! operation that would carry it out, and it is built where the check is
//! proposed. A caller that has one of them cannot have the other missing, and
//! that is a fact about a type rather than a rule for a reader to remember.
//!
//! # A command is named, never spelled
//!
//! [`CommandSpec`] carries a program, an argument vector, a working directory,
//! an environment policy, a deadline and an output bound as **named fields**.
//! There is no variant that takes a string to be split and no function in this
//! module that splits one. `process::ProcessRequest` has the same rule one
//! layer down; this is that rule carried back to where the work is first known,
//! so that the layer which knows a `package.json` declared `build` is also the
//! layer that decides the program is `npm` and the argument is `run build`.
//!
//! # A name with no extension is not a program on Windows
//!
//! [`crate::process`] records the measurement and this module inherits the
//! consequence. `CreateProcess` completes a name that has **no** extension with
//! `.exe` and nothing else, so a bare `npm` is not found on a machine where
//! `npm.cmd` is on `PATH`; and a `.cmd` named *with* its extension does start,
//! by starting a command interpreter to run the text inside it. A plan that
//! wrote `npm` would plan a command that cannot start and would report a spawn
//! failure where the truth is that this build will not run a batch file. A plan
//! that wrote `npm run build` would be the thing this module exists to prevent.
//!
//! [`ProgramPath`] is therefore a value with a question — *what is this name,
//! on this machine?* — and [`Resolution`] is its answer, in four parts that are
//! four different sentences in a report: an executable this build starts, a file
//! whose start would be an interpreter's, a file that is not a program, and
//! nothing at all. Which of the four came back is decided by the files on disk
//! and by no string formatting anywhere in this crate.
//!
//! # What this module does not decide
//!
//! **It does not decide whether the work may run.** Nothing here consults an
//! [`ExecutionMode`](sure_domain::execution::ExecutionMode), a permission or a
//! consent, and nothing here can: `crate::enforce` is the only thing that
//! answers that question and [`crate::enforce::AdmittedCommand`] is the only
//! value that carries a *yes*. A `CommandSpec` is not a launch and cannot be
//! made into one — `crate::process` and `crate::service` take what they start
//! from the enforcement, and this type is what the enforcement was asked about.
//!
//! **It does not run anything.** There is no spawn, no thread and no I/O in
//! this file. `tests/spawn_sites.rs` counts the places that build a `Command`
//! and this module is not one of them, which is what makes it safe for the
//! discovery layer to hold.
//!
//! **It does not make a resolved path trustworthy.** A name found on `PATH` is
//! a file on this machine that something else could replace between the plan and
//! the run. Resolving early is about saying the *honest* thing — "there is an
//! `npm.cmd` here and this build will not start it" rather than "there is no
//! `npm`" — and not about pinning a program down.
//!
//! **It does not search the current directory, and Windows would.** An empty
//! element of `PATH` means *the current directory* to `CreateProcess`, so a
//! project that writes `npm.exe` into its own folder is a project whose build
//! check resolves to its own file. [`ProgramPath::directories`] drops empty
//! entries for exactly that reason. The cost is real and is stated rather than
//! hidden: on a machine whose `PATH` ends in a separator, SURE would not find a
//! program that a shell in the same directory would — and a plan that names the
//! wrong program is a worse failure than a plan that finds none, because the
//! first one is a permission question asked about something the project chose.

    // **The fixture cannot be built on Windows.** A file created as `npm.` is
    // stored as `npm`: the Win32 layer strips trailing dots and spaces, so on
    // this machine `directory.join("npm.")` and `directory.join("npm")` name one
    // file, and a directory holding the first is a directory holding the second.
    // Measured rather than assumed: the test that asserted otherwise found
    // `…\trailing dot-6\npm` `Executable` on the first run.
    //
    // So the two implementations are indistinguishable here for *any* fixture,
    // and the distinction exists only on the platform where `npm.` is its own
    // file. What catches a joined suffix there is the test above this comment:
    // on a platform that completes a bare name with nothing, the join produces
    // `npm.`, the branch produces `npm`, and only one of those is the file the
    // fixture put on the path. **The collision the empty suffix guards against
    // is therefore reachable, and reachable nowhere the tests run** — which is
    // the same sentence as the defect it repairs, one layer along.
