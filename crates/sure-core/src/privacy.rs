//! What a run says about privacy, and about models, in the words a user reads.
//!
//! `docs/architecture/PRIVACY_AND_MODEL_STRATEGY.md` is the authoritative
//! statement of what the three privacy modes mean. This module is the other
//! half of it: the part a *run* has to make about the configuration it is
//! actually under, and about whether a model was consulted.
//!
//! # Why the mode here is not the mode a file names
//!
//! [`PrivacyMode`] is read in exactly one place that a user can see, and the
//! value it reports is [`Authority::privacy_mode`]'s — the arbitrated one.
//! A project file may ask for a behaviour and cannot grant itself one
//! (`docs/architecture/CONFIG_AUTHORITY.md`, ADR 0002, ADR 0011), so reporting
//! the value from the project's own `sure.yaml` would be a false statement about
//! the user's policy: worse than saying nothing, because it would read as an
//! answer.
//!
//! [`PrivacyStatement::project_mode`] carries what the project's own settings
//! come to as well, and the renderers use it for one purpose only — to say, when
//! the two differ, that the stricter one is the one in effect and that the
//! project's could not have been otherwise. It is never the reported mode.
//!
//! # Why model use is read from the run and not from a constant
//!
//! The tempting sentence is a constant: "no check in this build asks for
//! model-backed analysis, so no model was consulted". It is true today, and it
//! is the shape of statement this product exists to refuse — the day a check
//! does ask, a constant would keep saying the reassuring thing. So
//! [`ModelUse`] is read from the run's own record of stage 8, the one stage that
//! would ask a model, and the answer changes with the code rather than with
//! nobody's memory. `crate::pipeline::Pipeline::model_assessment` documents what
//! that stage records.
//!
//! # What this module will not say
//!
//! Nothing here is a claim about a model's behaviour. A privacy claim about what
//! a model received is not a fact SURE can establish, and asking the model is
//! not evidence about the model. Every sentence below is a fact about this run's
//! configuration and this run's own record.
