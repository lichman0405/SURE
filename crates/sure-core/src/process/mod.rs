//! The one place SURE runs a program.
//!
//! `docs/architecture/RUST_DESIGN.md` §Process execution lists what has to be
//! centralized: *executable + argument vector; cwd; environment allow/deny
//! behavior; timeout/cancellation; stdout/stderr capture and bounds;
//! exit/termination information; execution-trust classification; timing/evidence
//! metadata.* This module is all of that except classification — which is
//! `P3-T004`'s question, and belongs to a caller that has decided *whether* to
//! run something, not to the machinery that runs it.
//!
//! # The rule
//!
//! **Nothing about a run is inherited or assumed.** Not the working directory,
//! not the environment, not the time it has, not how much it may say. Every one
//! of them is a named field on a [`ProcessRequest`], stated by the caller, and
//! readable back before the run happens. Where a value could have had a
//! `Default`, it has a constructor argument instead.
//!
//! **There is no shell, and no door that takes one.** [`ProcessRequest`] holds
//! a program and a list of arguments, one element per argument, and nothing in
//! this module splits a string. A caller holding `npm install && npm test` has
//! a `String` and nowhere to put it. That is a statement about what **SURE**
//! assembles, and it is not the same as a fence around what runs: hand this
//! runner the path of a `.cmd` or a `.bat` and Windows starts a command
//! interpreter to run it, without having been asked. See "What is not here"
//! below for the measurement and for the two rules that bound how far it
//! reaches.
//!
//! # What is not here
//!
//! **This module is still a mechanism: it has exactly one caller, and that
//! caller has no caller.** [`crate::service`] starts a service by running a
//! [`ProcessRequest`] on a thread and stopping it through
//! [`ProcessRequest::cancellation`], so the runner has a real dependant rather
//! than none. Nothing in the product builds a `Supervisor` yet, though, so no
//! *ship* path reaches [`run`] — and that is again checkable rather than
//! asserted, because `tests/spawn_sites.rs` holds the census of files that may
//! name a `Supervisor`, and `sure check` still records a goal and says that
//! nothing was checked. The distinction it would be easy to lose: the runner is
//! no longer uncalled, it is still unreached by the product — and those are two
//! different facts about the same code. `P3-T010` (the port/HTTP probe) is the
//! next task that will run something through this path.
//!
//! **Windows brings a command interpreter to a batch file.** Measured on
//! Windows 11 with Rust 1.98, and held by tests in `tests/process_runner.rs`:
//! naming `C:\path\to\thing.cmd` runs it, and the process that runs is
//! `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe`. A `.bat` is the same, and so is a `npm.cmd`
//! found on `PATH` — so a caller that names a batch file gets a shell, not one
//! SURE built and not one anything here can take back. Two rules bound how far
//! that reaches, and both are the operating system's, not this module's:
//!
//! - A name with **no** extension is completed with `.exe` and nothing else, so
//!   a bare `npm` is not found on a machine where `npm.cmd` is on `PATH`, and a
//!   bare `build` does not reach the `build.cmd` sitting beside it. This is the
//!   rule that keeps a project directory full of shims from being run by a name
//!   that merely looks like one of them.
//! - A `.ps1` is refused outright — `CreateProcess` starts images, and a script
//!   is not one. That failure is `not a valid Win32 application`, which is a
//!   different fact from the "cannot find the file" above and is worth keeping
//!   distinct: one is a script that is not there, the other a script the
//!   operating system will not start without being told how.
//!
//! **Whether a batch file may be named is not decided here.** Running one is
//! running project-controlled shell text, which is `P3-T004`'s classification
//! and `P3-T005`'s permission question, and `P3-T007` is the one that enforces
//! the answer in `inspect_only` mode. This module records what happens rather
//! than settling it: a mechanism that quietly refused `.cmd` would be making
//! policy inside the machinery, and one that quietly allowed it while the
//! documentation said "no shell" would be the false green this repository treats
//! as the worst outcome there is.
//!
//! **Nothing here confines a process.** A deadline and an output bound are
//! bounds on SURE's *patience and memory*, not a boundary around the program.
//! A child started with [`Environment::Only`] and an empty list can still read
//! every file the user can read and reach the network. Sandboxing is `P3-T008`'s
//! question and its answer is a container, described in its own acceptance as
//! limited isolation rather than a perfect sandbox.
//!
//! **Only Windows reaches a whole process tree.** [`Stop`] carries which of the
//! two happened, so this is never inferred from the fact that a stop was asked
//! for. The `terminate` module's own documentation has the reason and what it
//! would take to change it.
//!
//! # What a run is held to
//!
//! | Part | Where it is stated | What happens without it |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | Program | [`ProcessRequest::new`] | cannot be built |
//! | Arguments | [`ProcessRequest::with_arguments`] | none, which is a run with no arguments |
//! | Working directory | [`ProcessRequest::new`] | cannot be built |
//! | Environment | [`ProcessRequest::with_environment`] | SURE's own is passed on |
//! | Deadline | [`Limits::new`] | cannot be built; there is no "no deadline" |
//! | Cancellation | [`ProcessRequest::new`] | cannot be built; see [`Cancellation`] |
//! | Output bound | [`Limits::new`] | cannot be built; see [`Limits`] |
//! | Stdin, pipes | this module, not a field | null in, piped out, always |
//!
//! The two rows that say "SURE's own is passed on" and "none" are the choices
//! that change nothing, and they are what [`Environment::inherited`] and an
//! empty argument list mean. They are still choices: the point of the rule is
//! that a caller who wanted something else had to say so, not that every
//! call site is verbose.
