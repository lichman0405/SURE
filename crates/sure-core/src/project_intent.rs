//! What SURE was told to check against, and which channel the words arrived on.
//!
//! # The one channel the checked project cannot write
//!
//! A project's README, its `sure.yaml`, its task list: every one of them is a
//! file inside the project, and the project is written by the same agent whose
//! work is being judged. A goal found in any of them is therefore
//! [`IntentSource::ProjectSpec`] — documentation — and
//! [`Config::goal_source`](crate::config::Config::goal_source) is the one place
//! that says so, in one line, for every caller.
//!
//! The command line is the other channel. `sure check --goal "…"` is words the
//! operator handed to SURE directly. They are
//! [`IntentSource::ExplicitUserGoal`], and that is one of only two sources
//! [`IntentSource::is_user_requirement`] accepts — which is the whole difference
//! between a project SURE may compare against what was asked for and a project
//! SURE may only describe. This module is where those words become a
//! [`Requirement`].
//!
//! # What "explicit" claims, and what it does not
//!
//! It claims **where the words entered SURE**: an argument to this program, not
//! a file inside the directory being checked. It does not claim that a person
//! typed them. SURE cannot authenticate the operator of its own command line,
//! and an agent that runs `sure check --goal "…"` supplies a goal exactly as a
//! person would. The label is a fact about the channel, and
//! `docs/architecture/PROJECT_INTENT.md` records the limit rather than letting
//! the word "explicit" imply a guarantee this module cannot make.
//!
//! # Why recording a goal is not full recording
//!
//! [`IntentSource::requires_full_recording`] is true of exactly one source,
//! [`IntentSource::ObservedUserRequest`], because that one is material captured
//! from a harness session — a transcript, kept only under the opt-in
//! `docs/security/PRIVACY.md` describes. A goal typed to SURE is not captured
//! material: there is no session and no transcript, and nothing is kept that the
//! user did not just hand over in the same breath. So the requirement is written
//! with [`raw_retained`](Requirement::raw_retained) set and no opt-in is
//! consulted, which is the second half of what this module exists for.
//!
//! # The wording is kept, and not tidied
//!
//! [`Requirement::text`] is documented as "normalized to one sentence where
//! possible", and a goal supplied on the command line is deliberately not
//! normalized at all: it is stored exactly as it arrived, minus nothing. SURE
//! rewording what the user asked for is the overclaim
//! `MASTER_PROMPT.md` §3 forbids, and a summary that dropped a clause would be
//! a requirement the user never stated. That is why
//! [`raw_retained`](Requirement::raw_retained) is set here rather than left
//! false: it is not a summary, and the flag says so.
//!
//! # Why one row per requirement
//!
//! `schemas/project-intent.schema.json` describes a single requirement, not the
//! container around it — `sure_protocol::documents` records why, and the short
//! version is that the container has no source of its own, being the union of
//! its requirements' sources. Storing an intent is therefore storing each of its
//! requirements, and a reader that wants the container back reassembles it.
