/// filesystem, plus `case` for the part of it that is a fact about the volume.
/// Everything that is not a case question is decided by the path itself and is

///
/// - separators: `C:\work\mine` and `C:/work/mine` are one spelling to
///   `Path`'s own parser on Windows, and Windows resolves both;
/// - a trailing separator: `C:\work\mine\` names the directory it is inside;
/// - a `.` segment: `C:\work\.\mine` names `C:\work\mine`;
/// - a `..` segment: folded where it can be, so `C:\work\mine\..\mine` is
///   `C:\work\mine` and `C:\work\mine\..` is **not** — it is `C:\work`;
/// - the drive letter's case: lowercased unconditionally, because Windows has
///   no uppercase `C:` distinct from `c:` and this is not a case-sensitivity
///   decision ([`crate::paths::compare`] says so where it does it);
/// - a verbatim prefix: `\\?\C:\work` and `C:\work` are one location.
///
/// Everything that *is* a case question is `case`'s, and `case` comes from the
/// volume rather than from this machine's name for itself — see
/// [`case_rule_for`] and [`crate::paths::volume`].
///
/// **What it is not.** Not a containment test. `same_path_case` requires both
/// paths to be the same length in components, so `C:\work` is not
/// `C:\work\mine`, `C:\work\mine` is not `C:\work\mine2`, and neither is
/// its own parent. A prefix comparison would match all three, and each of those
/// three is a genuinely different directory whose events would then be counted
/// as this project's.
///
/// **What it does when the two paths cannot be resolved.** Every `&str` is a
/// path, so there is no unresolved case at this level; what can fail is the
/// volume probe, and `case` is where that has already been decided. When the
/// volume cannot be asked — a `project_root` that is a file, that does not
/// exist, that cannot be listed, or that holds nothing whose case can be
/// flipped — [`case_rule_for`] answers [`CaseSensitivity::Sensitive`]. A stored
/// root that cannot be told apart from this one, and two stored roots that
/// differ only in case, are then two projects.
///
/// **Which way that errs.** Toward counting fewer events, never toward counting
/// another project's. The two mistakes are not symmetric, and this is the one
/// place in the product where the asymmetry is a verdict rather than a line:
///
/// - answering [`CaseSensitivity::Insensitive`] about a volume that keeps case
///   makes two genuinely different projects compare equal. This run's report
///   would then count **another project's** session as its own, the tier would
///   rise on evidence that is not about this project at all, and the counted
///   sentence would name it. That is a false green in the product's own voice,
///   and `CLAUDE.md` ranks it above every visible error;
/// - answering [`CaseSensitivity::Sensitive`] about a volume that folds means a
///   project SURE has a session for is reported as one it has never seen — the
///   tier falls to 0 and the notice names the events it did not count, so a
///   careful reader can diagnose it.
///
/// The second is a defect and the first is a false green, so an answer that
/// cannot be had is the second. The two answers agree wherever the volume is
/// the platform's default, which is why the direction costs nothing on the
/// machines this repository runs on.

/// *"no earlier run left anything open"* as a fact about the project rather than
/// as a failure to look. That was this function until `P7-T012`.
///
/// # Why this number
///
/// A bound rather than a promise, in the shape of [`crate::allowance::SCAN_LIMIT`]
/// and for the same reason. **The query is newest-first and the project filter is
/// applied in Rust after the limit**, so the budget is spent before this module
/// knows which of the rows belong to the project it was asked about: any limit
/// that is merely "big enough for this project" silently drops that project's
/// older runs, which is the same failure as `0` with a quieter symptom. The
/// number is therefore chosen against the store rather than against a project —
/// far more runs than any project accumulates between two checks, and a store
/// that reaches it has something wrong with it.
///
/// # The stronger fix, and why it is not this one
///
/// Spending the budget on other projects' rows is the underlying waste, and
/// [`HistoryFilter`](crate::store::HistoryFilter) is why it happens: the filter
/// carries `project_fingerprint` and **no `project_root`**, so this read cannot ask
/// the store for its own project's rows and must filter them in Rust afterwards.
/// Pushing `project_root` into the query would make this bound count *this
/// project's* records and shrink the truncation to a project nobody has 4096
/// findings about. It is deliberately **not** taken here, and this is the paragraph
/// that says so:
///
/// - **It does not remove the need for the check above.** One project's own rows
///   can pass any bound, and the failure direction has to be right whatever the
///   number counts — which is this task's acceptance, not that change's.
/// - **It is a change to a type used well beyond this module.**
///   `git grep -l 'HistoryFilter' crates/` names 19 files — 13 under
///   `sure-core/src`, two core test files and four under `sure-cli` — and each of
///   them would have to decide whether it means a project-scoped scan now.
/// - **It re-decides the number rather than only the plumbing.** A bound of 4096
///   *rows in the store* and a bound of 4096 *rows for one project* are different
///   quantities with different reasons, and the paragraph above argues for the
///   first.
///
/// So it belongs in its own task, with its own number and its own acceptance.
/// Riding along with this one would have changed what every other caller's filter
/// does under cover of a task about failure direction.
///
/// **That is where the resemblance to `allowance::SCAN_LIMIT` ends, and this
/// paragraph used to claim otherwise.** `Store::spend_allowance` reads its bound
/// and then acts on it — `store/mod.rs:583` returns `None` when the scan
/// saturates, and `None` means spend nothing, so an exhausted allowance fails
/// **closed**. The supervisor corrected the false half of that claim in the
/// `P7-T012` acceptance commit, and what it corrected was the *sentence*: the
/// number is the same and the failure direction was opposite, because a bound that
/// fails in `spend_allowance` makes SURE *do* less while a bound that failed here
/// made SURE *claim* less is wrong — a false green rather than a refusal. The
/// correction could not repair the behaviour, because [`previous_open_findings`]
/// had no check for a correction to add to; **`P15-T029` added one**, and the
/// direction now matches `spend_allowance`'s: a scan that stops at this bound
/// returns [`HistoryReadError::ScanStoppedEarly`], which `pipeline::recheck`
/// reports as stage 12 not running with that error as the detail, so reaching the
/// bound makes SURE do less and the reassuring answer is the one it will not give.
///
/// The 4096 is still a judgement about scale: no fixture or test was found that
/// reaches it in practice, and none is claimed here. What `P15-T029` added is a
/// test that reaches it **on purpose** and a read that fails closed when it does.
///
/// # What this bound does not affect, so that it is not rediscovered
///
/// **Nothing consumes [`LifecycleUpdate::findings`]** — checked, not assumed:
/// `git grep -n 'lifecycle' crates/` finds the field declared at `:135`, produced
/// by `pipeline::recheck`, carried on `RunOutcome.lifecycle` (`pipeline.rs:461`),
/// and read by callers that take `kept_open` and `resolved` only (the CLI's human
/// line and machine frame for stage 12; `pipeline.rs`'s own detail in
/// `recheck`). So the blast radius of a truncation used to be bounded to the
/// `Against the earlier run: N finding(s) still open` line and stage 12's detail,
/// and never reached `run.verdict.findings`, the open-finding counts or hand-off
/// readiness. **That bound on the damage is what changed first**: a saturated scan
/// now makes stage 12 not run, so the two lines a reader would have got are absent
/// rather than short — and because `StageOutcome::NotRun` is a gap,
/// [`crate::pipeline::PipelineOutcome::is_green`] is false for that run. Whoever
/// gives `LifecycleUpdate::findings` a consumer inherits the reason this read
/// refuses instead of answering.

/// one condition. A scan that reached its bound is not a store failure at all — the

/// allowed, which may or may not be everything — so it needs a variant of its own,
/// because reporting it as a store failure would send a reader looking for a
/// damaged file that is not damaged.
///
/// **Why this is an error and not a flag on a short list.** A list that stopped at
/// a bound is indistinguishable, to its caller, from a list that was read to the
/// end and found nothing: `previous_open_findings` would answer `Ok(vec![])` for a
/// project whose earlier run left something open, whenever that project's rows
/// sort past the bound. That is the failure `CLAUDE.md` ranks above every other —
/// *"a false green is more serious than a visible error"* — and the way out is the
/// one `Store::spend_allowance` takes at `store/mod.rs:583`: refuse.
///
/// **The other precedent in this tree, and why it is not the one followed.**
/// [`crate::capability_report`] reads a store with `EVENT_SCAN_LIMIT` and, when the
/// scan reaches it, **succeeds with `CapabilityEvidence::truncated` set**
/// (`capability_report.rs:234`); the flag is a field on the report and adds a
/// sentence beside the number it qualifies — *"SURE stopped before it had read every
/// event the store holds, so anything older than the events it read is not counted
/// here"* (`sure_domain::capability:281`). **What a flag would cost here is two
/// things that precedent does not have to pay.** The count this read produces is
/// composed away from the read: the CLI's `Against the earlier run: N finding(s)
/// still open` line is `LifecycleUpdate::kept_open.len()`, so the caveat would have
/// to be carried through `reconcile` and out to every caller that prints the number
/// or it would be a flag nobody reads. And a stage that ran with a caveat is a
/// stage that **ran**, so `PipelineOutcome::is_green` would be true for a run whose
/// comparison with the previous run was built from a list that stopped early — the

///
/// # One entry per finding, not one per row
///
/// [`store_run`] writes **every** finding on **every** run, so a project checked
/// five times has five stored rows per open finding. Returning them all made the
/// re-check report a count that grew with how often the project had been looked
/// at rather than with how many problems it had — measured, before this rule
/// existed: three runs over one unchanged project, and the third said `6 earlier
/// finding(s) stayed open` for three findings.
///
/// The identity to deduplicate on is [`FindingKey`], because the id is minted per
/// run — that is what the key exists for. [`Store::history`] returns newest-first,
/// so the record kept is the most recent reading of that finding. A finding with
/// no key at all (nothing a reader could be pointed at) is **kept rather than
/// dropped**: SURE cannot tell two of them apart, so it cannot choose between them
/// without discarding a record it has no basis to call a duplicate.
///
/// **`case` decides how much that deduplication takes out**, and it is the same
/// rule [`reconcile`] matches by — the caller asks the volume once per run
/// ([`case_rule_for`]) and hands the one answer to both, because two rules here
/// would mean a finding this function dropped as a duplicate reappearing as a
/// finding of its own one call later. On a volume that folds case, a stored
/// `src/EMAIL/SEND.rs` and a stored `src/email/send.rs` are one finding and the
/// newer row wins; on a volume that keeps it they are two, because they are two
/// files.
///
/// # Which rows are this project's
///
/// A row is this project's when its stored `project_root` and this run's
/// `project_root` name one directory, which is [`same_project_root`]'s question
/// rather than a string comparison — the same spelling rule, and the same
/// `case`, that the deduplication below matches findings by. A run started from
/// `C:/projects/sendmail` after one started from `C:\projects\sendmail` is the
/// same project asked about twice, and answering it with "no earlier run left
/// anything open" would be the same false statement about the store that
/// `crate::capability_report` refuses to make about the tier.
///
/// # Why there is no project-state filter
///
/// There was one, and it could never fire: it skipped a record whose
/// `project_fingerprint` equalled the current run's, but a
/// [`ProjectFingerprint`](sure_domain::vocabulary::ProjectFingerprint) carries a
/// **minted** id beside its content digest, so two runs over identical bytes carry
/// two different ids. The comparison is now gone rather than corrected to
/// [`matches`](sure_domain::vocabulary::ProjectFingerprint::matches), because
/// filtering by state would drop exactly the findings a re-check is for: a finding
/// an earlier run left open against the state the project is still in is the one a
/// reader most needs to see. Deduplicating on the key bounds the list; the state
/// it was raised against does not make it any less open.
///
/// # Errors

/// [`HistoryReadError::ScanStoppedEarly`] when the scan reached
