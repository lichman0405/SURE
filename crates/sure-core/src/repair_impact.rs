//! Select the checks that should be re-run after a repair.
//!
//! The repair contract already carries a `recheck` list from the finding that
//! generated it. This module adds two things to that list:
//!
//! 1. **Affected checks** whose own anchor overlaps an evidence anchor from the
//!    contract, because a fix that touches a location should re-verify any check
//!    that is about that location.
//! 2. **Relevant regression checks** — deterministic checks that run project code
//!    and are serious enough that a side-effect of the fix would matter — because
//!    a repair that only re-runs the original check can hide breakage elsewhere.
//!
//! The result is de-duplicated and kept in schedule order, so the re-check plan
//! is stable and readable.
//!
//! # The circularity, and the seed that breaks it
//!
//! [`select_impacted_checks`] takes a [`RepairContract`], and
//! `RepairContract::from_finding` refuses an empty re-check list — so the
//! selector cannot be called before the constructor that needs its answer. The
//! way out is not to loosen either: it is [`seed_rechecks`], which reads a
//! [`Finding`] alone and returns the checks that finding already names.
//!
//! **The seed is a subset of what [`select_impacted_checks`] returns, and that is
//! why it is not a second rule.** The selector's first act is to copy the
//! contract's own `recheck` list into its answer; the contract's `recheck` list is
//! the seed. So every check the seed names is in the selection by construction,
//! and the seed can only ever be the smaller of the two. What the seed must not
//! do — and does not — is decide anything the selector decides: it adds no
//! anchored check, no regression check, and no check the finding did not name.

/// The checks a finding names as able to observe whether it is fixed.
///
/// # What it reads
///
/// Every evidence anchor on the finding whose `subject_id` is a check, in the
/// order the anchors appear. A finding built by
/// [`crate::findings_from_checks`] carries exactly one, and it is the check whose
/// result produced the finding — the check that was failing, or the check that
/// was planned and did not run.
///
/// This is the seed `crates/sure-core/tests/repair_fixture_e2e.rs` used to name
/// by hand before the rule had a home; that file now calls this function like
/// every other caller, so there is one answer to *which check can observe whether
/// this is fixed* rather than a product answer and a test answer that agree today.
///
/// # What it refuses
///
/// An anchor whose text names no check is not a seed, and neither is one whose
/// identifier is not a [`CheckId`] — a finding that names no check gets an empty
/// list, and an empty list is what `RepairContract::from_finding` refuses. That
/// refusal is the point: a one-check contract naming a check nobody can run
/// (`RepairContract::from_finding_with_one_check` with a generated identifier) is
/// a contract that satisfies the letter of the rule and is unactionable, and this
/// function cannot produce one.
///
/// # `schedule`
///
/// The identifiers are filtered to checks the run's own schedule holds, so a seed
/// is always something a re-check could actually re-run. An identifier that is
/// absent from the schedule is dropped rather than returned: the selector keeps
/// contract identifiers the schedule has lost, because a contract outlives the
/// schedule it was built from, but a *seed* built here is being built for a
/// contract that is about to be made from this very run, and a check this run did
/// not plan is a check this run cannot re-check.
