//! What a command may do, read from the command line SURE assembled.
//!
//! `P3-T004` acceptance: *"Static/read-only, dynamic host, install, network,
//! destructive categories are distinct."* The five categories are
//! [`sure_domain::execution::CommandClass`]; this module is the rule that puts a
//! command into them, and [`classify`] is its only door.
//!
//! # Why this is not in `process`
//!
//! [`crate::process`] runs a program. This module decides **whether what it
//! would run is a thing SURE is allowed to do**, and that is a question asked by
//! a caller *before* there is anything to run — so the runner does not depend on
//! this module, this module does not depend on the runner, and neither imports
//! the other. `process/mod.rs` states the same split from its own side. The
//! shape of [`classify`] follows from it: it takes a program name and an
//! argument vector, which is exactly what a caller has before it builds a
//! [`ProcessRequest`](crate::process::ProcessRequest) — and taking one of those
//! instead would make this module a caller of the runner and trip the rule in
//! `tests/spawn_sites.rs` that is there to notice.
//!
//! # The one rule that makes this safe to use
//!
//! **Nothing is [`CommandClass::Static`] unless a rule in this file says so.**
//! Every other answer is available as a fallback and `Static` is not one of
//! them:
//!
//! - a program this table does not know is [`Source::UnknownProgram`];
//! - a program it knows and an operation it does not is
//!   [`Source::UnknownOperation`];
//! - a command line whose meaning is in text SURE cannot read is
//!   [`Source::UnreadText`].
//!
//! All three land on the same [`CommandEffects`]: every category **except**
//! `Static`. That is the direction the whole module fails in. A classifier that
//! answered "read-only" for a command it did not recognise would be the false
//! green this product exists to prevent, and it is the one mistake here that no
//! downstream check could catch.
//!
//! The four sources are kept apart because they have four different follow-ups.
//! An unknown program means the table needs a row; an unknown operation means
//! the same program needs a row; unread text is the only one of the four that
//! more table work cannot fix, because the command SURE assembled is not what
//! decides what runs. A reader who sees only "not static" learns none of that.
//!
//! # The answer is a set, and it is an upper bound
//!
//! `cargo add serde` installs a package *and* reaches the registry. One value
//! would have to drop one of those facts, so the answer is a
//! [`CommandEffects`] — and **it is always an over-approximation**: the
//! categories the command *may* fall into, never a claim that it does all of
//! them. Asking for one consent too many costs a prompt; asking for one too few
//! is the failure this module exists to prevent, so where a form is uncertain
//! the class is added rather than argued away.
//!
//! Two flag rules are applied to every program, because both flags mean the same
//! thing wherever they appear:
//!
//! - **`--dry-run`** takes away [`CommandClass::Install`] and
//!   [`CommandClass::Destructive`] — the two that change this machine. It does
//!   **not** take away [`CommandClass::Network`]: a dry run still looks. A
//!   command left with nothing takes its program's own class instead, which is
//!   how `git clean --dry-run` reads as the report it is.
//! - **`--offline`** takes away [`CommandClass::Network`]. Only that spelling,
//!   deliberately: `--frozen` means "do not update the lockfile" to some tools
//!   and "do not touch the network" to others, and a rule that guessed which
//!   would be reading two tools' grammars as one.
//!
//! # The name is read the way the operating system reads it
//!
//! [`classify`] takes the last path component, and on Windows it does two more
//! things the operating system does: it ignores case, and it elides a trailing
//! `.exe`. On Unix it does neither, because neither is true there — and
//! lowercasing there would classify a program SURE never looked at, which is
//! how a project's own `GIT` on `PATH` would be read as git. The condition is
//! `cfg!(windows)` and not `#[cfg(windows)]`, so both arms are compiled and the
//! difference is a value rather than a deleted branch.
//!
//! A `.cmd` or `.bat` **name** is unread text, whatever it is called and
//! whatever is in it. `npm.cmd` on a Windows `PATH` is a batch file that
//! forwards to a JavaScript file, and it would be comfortable to read the name
//! and answer for the file behind it — but **a name is not evidence of
//! behaviour**. The decision is stated rather than dodged: `process/mod.rs`
//! records that Windows starts `cmd.exe` for such a name without being asked,
//! and this module's answer is that SURE cannot see what runs.
//!
//! # What this does not establish
//!
//! **Nothing about the code the command runs.** The categories are a statement
//! about the command SURE was asked to run, not about everything the code it
//! runs might do — the domain's own model is the same, where
//! `Permission::RunProjectCode` is a separate decision from
//! `Permission::Network` and neither implies the other. A project's test script
//! can delete a directory; that is a fact about the script.
//!
//! **Nothing about what is on `PATH`.** This is a classifier for names, and it
//! does not look for the program, does not stat it, and does not read it. A
//! project that puts its own `git.exe` first on `PATH` gets that classified as
//! git. Finding the program is a different question, and answering it here would
//! not make the answer safe: the file can be replaced between the looking and
//! the running.
//!
//! **No shell grammar, and no wrapper is read through.** `env`, `timeout`,
//! `nice`, `xargs`, `sudo` and `cmd` are not looked behind, because a wrapper is
//! an argument grammar SURE would have to implement before it could see the
//! program behind it — and a grammar implemented by guesswork produces a
//! confident answer about a program nobody read. All of them are unread text or
//! unknown programs, which is the loud answer.
//!
//! **No category for writing inside the project.** The acceptance names five,
//! and "changes files in this directory without destroying anything" is not one
//! of them — so a command whose only effect is that is **not** a sixth class and
//! **not** `Static`. `git commit` and `git branch -m` are
//! [`Source::UnknownOperation`]: the table does not have a row that fits them,
//! and adding `Static` beside them would say a command that writes the
//! repository only reads it. `git pull` is different and is classified, because
//! one of *its* effects — reaching the network — is a class the vocabulary has.
//! Where the sixth category should live is `P3-T005`'s question, and inventing
//! it here would put a permission decision in the classifier.
//!
//! **Not a list of every program SURE will ever run.** The table below holds
//! what SURE's own discovery names today — `cargo test`, `npm test`,
//! `npm run build`, `python -m pytest`, `python -m pip install`,
//! `uv run pytest`, `uv sync`, `poetry run pytest` — and the neighbours a reader
//! would expect to find beside them. Every other program is
//! [`Source::UnknownProgram`], which is the safe answer and a visible one: the
//! source says the table is where the work is.
