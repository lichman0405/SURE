//! The names that are not project content.
//!
//! Two tables, in one place, so that what SURE declines to look at is a list
//! somebody can read and disagree with rather than a rule spread through the
//! walker.
//!
//! # Why files and directories are separate tables
//!
//! `build` is a directory full of compiled output, and `build` is also a shell
//! script at the root of a great many projects — one a person wrote, typed by
//! hand, and would be right to expect SURE to read. The same is true of `target`
//! and `dist`. A single table keyed on the name alone cannot tell those apart,
//! and the version that cannot tell them apart loses a file that is genuinely
//! part of the project.
//!
//! So a rule says which kind of entry it is about, and the two tables are
//! separate because that is the honest shape of the knowledge: *this name is
//! never a directory a project keeps its work in* and *this name is never a file
//! a project keeps its work in* are two different claims, each true of a
//! different set of names.
//!
//! # Why matching is by exact name and not by pattern
//!
//! A glob language — `**/target/**`, `*.pyc` — is more expressive and much
//! harder to be sure about. The question these tables answer is narrow ("is this
//! name always something a tool produced rather than something a person wrote
//! for this project?"), and a name that cannot answer it plainly does not belong
//! in a table. Patterns arrive when something needs them.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not in either table
//!
//! `bin`, `obj`, `out`, `Debug`, `Release` and `third_party` are all output or
//! vendor directory names for some toolchain, and all of them are ordinary
//! directory names too — `bin/` holds hand-written scripts in a great many Node
//! and Python projects, and `third_party/` is usually vendored source that the
//! project is answerable for. Leaving a real directory out of a scan is a
//! **loss**, so a name that could plausibly be project content stays out of the
//! tables and in the scan. `dist`, `build` and `target` are in the directory
//! table because a project that keeps its own source in `build/` is rare enough
//! that being told "SURE did not look inside build/" is a better failure than
//! silently reading a stale output tree.
//!
//! # Case
//!
//! A name is compared under the platform's case rule, and [`matching_rule`]
//! takes that rule as an argument so both can be tested on one machine. On
//! Windows there is no `NODE_MODULES` distinct from `node_modules`, so it is the
//! same directory and the same answer. On Linux there is, and a directory called
//! `NODE_MODULES` there is a directory the project made.
