//! Looking at a project's files, within limits it states.
//!
//! This is step 1 of `docs/architecture/CHECK_PIPELINE.md` — *discover* — and
//! everything after it reads what comes out of here. It is therefore the place
//! where a silent loss turns into a wrong answer much later, with nothing in
//! between able to notice.
//!
//! # The three guarantees
//!
//! **It stays inside the project it was given.** Children are built by joining
//! one directory-entry name onto a path that was already inside, and a name
//! from the operating system is a single component with no separator and no
//! `..`. Links are never followed ([`SkipReason::NotFollowed`]). Those two
//! rules are the whole containment argument, and it is an argument from
//! construction rather than a check that could be wrong: there is no reachable
//! state in which the walk holds a path outside the root, so there is no
//! `SkipReason::Outside` for one to be recorded as.
//!
//! A project reached through a link — `C:\work\current` junctioned to a
//! checkout somewhere else — is followed at the *root*, because the caller
//! named it. Everything below that is reported relative to it.
//!
//! **It is bounded.** [`ScanOptions::max_depth`] stops the walk going down, and
//! [`ScanOptions::max_entries`] stops it going wide. Both are limits on work
//! done, so neither can be exceeded by a project that is merely large, and both
//! are recorded in the result when they bite. A directory of two hundred
//! thousand files does not make SURE hang; it makes SURE say it stopped.
//!
//! **It says what it did not look at.** [`Scan::entries`] is what was found and
//! [`Scan::skipped`] is what was not, and the second is not a log. See
//! [`skip`] for why, and [`Scan::is_complete`] for the one question a caller
//! must answer before treating the first as the whole project.
//!
//! # What it does not do
//!
//! **It reads no file contents.** This is an enumeration: names, and whether
//! each is a file or a directory. Nothing here opens a file, so a scan of a
//! project whose files are enormous, encrypted, on a slow network share or
//! placeholders that would be fetched from a cloud provider costs the same as a
//! scan of any other. Deciding what to read, and reading it, is the
//! fingerprint's job (P2-T002, P2-T003) and the readers' jobs after that.
//!
//! **It does nothing about `.gitignore`.** A project's own ignore file is a
//! statement about what belongs in the repository, which is a different
//! question from what belongs in a check — a test fixture deliberately kept out
//! of a repository is still worth reading, and a file the project forgot to
//! ignore is not made uninteresting by being tracked. Reading those rules is a
//! decision for a task that needs it, with its own evidence.
//!
//! **It does not decide what anything is.** Finding `package.json` here does
//! not mean the project is a Node project; that is P2-T004 onwards.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! Entries come out in a fixed order: directories are listed in name order and
//! descended into as they are reached, so the result is the same on every run
//! on every filesystem. Names are compared as the operating system gives them
//! rather than through a lossy text conversion — two names that are distinct
//! bytes but the same replacement characters would compare equal as text, and a
//! comparison that ties leaves the order up to the sort. A fingerprint taken
//! over a list whose order moves is a fingerprint that changes when nothing
//! did.
