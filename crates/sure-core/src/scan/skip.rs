//! What a scan did not look at, and why.
//!
//! A scanner that walks a project and returns a list of files has told you
//! nothing about the files it did not return. If a directory could not be read,
//! or was left out because it was too deep, or the walk stopped at a limit, the
//! list is shorter and nothing in it says so — and every later stage that
//! reasons over the list inherits the loss without being able to see it. A
//! verdict built on that list is the exact failure this product exists to
//! prevent: a green result that means "nothing was found" when it should mean
//! "nothing was looked at".
//!
//! So a skip is a **value**, and it is carried alongside the entries rather than
//! being logged and dropped. [`Skipped`] is what the scanner returns instead of
//! silence.
//!
//! # Two kinds of skip, and only one of them is a loss
//!
//! Most skips are the scan's declared scope. `.git` is not project content,
//! `node_modules` is somebody else's code, `target/` is regenerable, and
//! `__pycache__` is a cache. Those are reported so a person can see what was
//! left out and disagree, but nothing was lost by leaving them out.
//!
//! The rest are losses: a directory SURE could not list, one deeper than the
//! depth limit, the point at which the entry budget ran out, a link it declined
//! to follow. Anything could have been in there. [`SkipReason::loses_coverage`]
//! is the predicate that separates them, and [`Scan::is_complete`] is the one
//! question a caller has to answer before treating a scan as the whole project.
//!
//! Both predicates are written as full matches over the enum rather than one
//! being the negation of the other. A `!is_by_design()` would answer for a
//! variant nobody thought about, and the answer it gave would be "not a loss"
//! — the quiet direction.
//!
//! [`Scan::is_complete`]: super::Scan::is_complete
