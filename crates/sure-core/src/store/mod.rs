//! SURE's local record store.
//!
//! One SQLite file, at the user-level data directory, holding one row per
//! document SURE wrote down. `docs/architecture/STORAGE_AND_DATA_PATHS.md` is
//! the rule this implements; this module is where it becomes code.
//!
//! # Why SQLite, and why bundled
//!
//! `docs/architecture/RUST_DESIGN.md` names "bundled/portable SQLite binding" as
//! the intended choice, and the acceptance criterion is that storage *packages
//! without requiring system SQLite*. `rusqlite`'s `bundled` feature compiles
//! SQLite from source into `sure.exe`, so an installation carries its own
//! database engine. The alternative — linking whatever `sqlite3.dll` happens to
//! be on the machine — would make SURE's behaviour depend on a library the user
//! did not install for SURE and cannot tell us about, and a lock or page-size
//! difference there is not something SURE could detect or report honestly.
//!
//! A hand-written storage engine was the other option, and it was rejected for
//! the same reason the schemas are checked by a hand-written validator only
//! after that was argued for: crash-safe transactional writes and multi-process
//! locking are the two things SURE most needs from this layer, and they are
//! exactly the two things an ad-hoc file format gets wrong in ways that show up
//! months later as records that lost their tail. SQLite is the piece of this
//! system that has been wrong for forty years in public and is now right.
//!
//! # The concurrency contract
//!
//! `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `RUST_DESIGN.md` both name the case:
//! short-lived hook processes contend for the same database. `sure hook ingest`
//! may be started by several harness events at once, each process opening the
//! store, writing one row and exiting.
//!
//! The defined behaviour, in full:
//!
//! 1. **Every write is one transaction**, `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` to `COMMIT`. A
//!    process that dies part-way through leaves either the whole row or no row,
//!    never half of one. This is the property that makes a truncated record
//!    impossible rather than merely unlikely.
//! 2. **Writers serialise.** At most one holds the write lock; the others wait
//!    in SQLite's busy handler, not in a retry loop of SURE's invention.
//! 3. **The wait is bounded**, by [`StoreOptions::busy_timeout`]. Past it,
//!    SQLite returns `SQLITE_BUSY` and SURE reports [`StoreError::Busy`].
//! 4. **A timeout is reported, never retried and never dropped.** There is no
//!    outer retry loop, because an unbounded retry turns "the database is
//!    contended" into "SURE hangs", and a dropped event turns it into a project
//!    with nothing recorded about it. Both are worse than a message.
//! 5. **`synchronous = FULL`.** A committed write survives power loss. Evidence
//!    that can vanish without a trace is worse than evidence that is slower;
//!    each hook process writes one row, so the cost is one fsync per event.
//!
//! Read concurrency depends on the journal mode: [`Store::journal_mode`] reports
//! what this file actually got. Under `wal`, readers never block the writer and
//! the writer never blocks readers. On a filesystem that refuses `wal` — a
//! network share, sometimes — SQLite falls back to `delete`, and readers then
//! wait for the writer. Writes are unaffected either way, which is why the
//! contract above is stated unconditionally and this paragraph is not.
//!
//! # The one wait that is not the busy handler's
//!
//! Point 2 above has an exception, and it is the exception a new installation
//! meets first. Putting a rollback-journal file into `wal` needs a moment of
//! exclusive access, and SQLite's busy handler deliberately does not cover it —
//! `sqlite3_busy_handler`'s own documentation names the journal-mode change as a
//! case where waiting could deadlock, so the change returns `SQLITE_BUSY` at
//! once. Opening a database that does not exist yet is exactly that moment, and
//! several hooks firing together is exactly that contention.
//!
//! [`establish_journal_mode`] therefore waits for it, up to the same
//! [`StoreOptions::busy_timeout`], and reports [`StoreError::Busy`] if it runs
//! out. It is the only retry in this module, and it is bounded by the same
//! deadline as everything else rather than by a count of attempts.
//!
//! # Where the file goes
//!
//! [`Store::open`] takes the [`crate::paths::Paths`] and the project root, and
//! refuses a project that contains the store. That check is not optional and is
//! not the caller's to remember: evidence inside the project can be edited by
//! the agent whose work is being judged, so a stored result would stop being
//! evidence of anything. [`Store::open_at`] skips the check and exists for
//! tests and for `sure doctor`, which has no project in hand.
//!
//! # What is not here
//!
//! No asynchronous API and no connection pool. `RUST_DESIGN.md` says "do not
//! hold synchronous DB resources across `.await`", and the way that is honoured
//! is that this workspace has no async runtime at all — a rule enforced by a
//! test in `tests/store_packaging.rs` rather than by discipline. If one arrives,
//! that test fails and the store has to be reconsidered, which is the point.
