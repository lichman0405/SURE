//! The one support level for the thing a person pointed SURE at.
//!
//! Step 1 of `docs/architecture/CHECK_PIPELINE.md` ends *"…and support level."*
//! [`crate::discover`] answers that per ecosystem — what each manifest declared,
//! and how well SURE understands it. This module answers it for the **project**,
//! the directory the person named, and fills
//! [`Project::support`](sure_domain::vocabulary::Project::support).
//!
//! `docs/product/SUPPORTED_STACKS.md` is the authority for what the three levels
//! mean, and it defines them by what SURE can **do**:
//!
//! | Level | The product doc's definition |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | A — `first_class` | framework-aware discovery **and meaningful deterministic checks** |
//! | B — `generic` | discover common manifests/commands **and run approved generic checks** |
//! | C — `inspect_only` | inspect files and config, lacking safe or reliable run semantics |
//!
//! # The rule
//!
//! **The project's level is the weakest of two things: what SURE read, and what
//! SURE can do with it.**
//!
//! [`weakest`] takes both. Neither alone is the answer: a project whose manifest
//! SURE read perfectly would still be level A if reading were all a level
//! claimed, and a project with no manifest at all would still be level A if
//! capability were all it claimed. The level is a claim about what a person gets
//! from pointing SURE at this directory, and that is the smaller of the two.
//!
//! # Why the ceiling is [`SupportLevel::InspectOnly`] in this build
//!
//! Both level A and level B include *running* something — "meaningful
//! deterministic checks", "approved generic checks" — and **as of `P18-T007` this
//! build does run a project's checks**. [`crate::pipeline`] asks
//! [`crate::enforce`] about every check the schedule holds, keeps the ones the
//! mode and the permissions admit, and hands those to
//! [`crate::planned_check_runner`], the one file that turns a planned command
//! into a request for [`crate::process`]'s runner. The sentence this section used
//! to carry — *"this build runs no project code"* — is **false today and is
//! written nowhere in `crates/` or `docs/` any more**.
//!
//! What is still true, and what this section is now for, is why the ceiling did
//! not move with it. Two things, and neither one is "nothing can run":
//!
//! **A run under the default mode still reaches no process.** `inspect_only` is
//! the mode a run starts in, and the mode a *project* file cannot move in either
//! direction: [`crate::config::Authority::execution_mode`] answers it unless the
//! **user's own** file grants `run_project_code` and names a mode that runs
//! project code (`docs/architecture/CONFIG_AUTHORITY.md`). Under it
//! [`crate::enforce`] admits no command that starts a process, so the runner is
//! never asked — and that is measured rather than asserted: `pipeline.rs`'s
//! `a_run_a_user_did_not_grant_starts_nothing` runs the real pipeline over a Rust
//! project with a runner that records being called, and asserts the record is
//! empty.
//!
//! **And that is measured, in three parts that do not agree**
//! (`docs/adr/0015-support-ceiling-evidence.md` holds the readings; this
//! paragraph is the answer they produced).
//!
//! * **Windows, a Node project: the check is stopped.** Measured on this
//!   workstation through this module's own resolver —
//!   `ProgramPath::of_this_machine().resolve(OsStr::new("npm"))` answers
//!   `Resolution::InterpreterRequired("C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.cmd")` and
//!   `is_startable()` is false, and the same is true of `npx` and `pnpm`.
//!   **The extensionless `npm` file is on `PATH` and is not the answer**: the
//!   Windows completion table probes `com`/`exe`/`bat`/`cmd`/`ps1` and never the
//!   bare name, so the file that would run on macOS resolves to a batch file
//!   this build declines to start (the alternative
//!   `docs/adr/0014-planned-check-execution-contract.md` rejected).
//! * **Windows, a Rust project: the runner is reached, and no test runs the
//!   check to completion.** `cargo` and `git` resolve `Executable`, and
//!   `pipeline.rs`'s `a_run_a_user_granted_reaches_the_runner_and_is_never_
//!   reported_as_passed` shows a run under a user's own grant reaching a runner.
//!   Every product-path test that reaches the real runner hands it a
//!   `Cancellation` cancelled before the run began, so **what is measured is the
//!   seam and not a project's check finishing and passing** — on any platform.
//! * **macOS and Linux: the table says yes and the legs are green.** The
//!   non-Windows completion resolves a bare `npm` file to `Executable`
//!   (`planned_work.rs`'s `WITHOUT_PATHEXT`, tested on Windows by
//!   `a_platform_that_completes_a_bare_name_with_nothing_finds_the_name_itself`),
//!   and `ci`'s `rust (macos-latest)` and `rust (ubuntu-latest)` legs passed on
//!   `f8db077`. **This paragraph said the opposite until `P18-T012`** — that
//!   those legs "have never run at all" — and that was a recollection rather
//!   than a reading; it is the one part of the ceiling's stated reason a
//!   measurement contradicted.
//!
//! Level B is one sentence and those three parts do not agree, so the ceiling
//! takes the weaker one. A constant cannot say *yes for a Rust project on
//! Windows, no for a Node project on the same machine, and unmeasured on the
//! other two platforms*, and reporting the yes would be the same defect one
//! level up as reporting a check as passed because nothing went wrong. ADR 0014
//! stated the rule this module follows — a ceiling moves when measurements earn
//! it, and its default outcome is that it does not — and `P18-T012` is where
//! those measurements were taken: **they did not earn it, for a reason this
//! module now states as a reading rather than as the absence of one.**
//!
//! **The census that used to be the evidence for the ceiling is now the evidence
//! for something narrower, and deliberately so.** `tests/spawn_sites.rs` holds
//! the list of files that may name a `Supervisor`, a `StartSmoke` or a
//! `ProcessRequest`, and the product now reaches that last one — through
//! `pipeline.rs` into `planned_check_runner.rs`. So the claim is no longer "no
//! product path reaches the runner" but **"the product path that reaches the
//! runner can only start what the mode admitted"**, which is the property
//! `enforce.rs` was built to have: a command arrives at a runner as an admitted
//! value or not at all. That file's paragraphs carry the argument; this one only
//! points at it. [`crate::doctor`] is the other side of the same discipline — it
//! looks for the programs a build on this machine uses and reports where each one
//! is, which is SURE talking about its own prerequisites without running any of
//! them. *Probes* would be a claim this build cannot make, and it does not make
//! it.
//!
//! So the honest answer for every project in this build is still level C, and
//! [`CEILING`] is what says so in one place. It is a constant rather than a
//! comment because a claim this load-bearing wants a name that code can point
//! at: the day the readings earn a level, this is the line that changes, and
//! `the_ceiling_todays_build_claims_is_never_above_inspect_only` fails until
//! somebody raises it deliberately.
//!
//! # A conflict in the vocabulary, recorded rather than resolved quietly
//!
//! `docs/architecture/ECOSYSTEM_DISCOVERY.md`'s grade tables award `Generic` to
//! any project with a readable manifest, with the reason *"SURE can find how the
//! project is built and run"* — that is, SURE can find **the commands**. The
//! product doc's level B is a higher bar: finding the commands **and running
//! approved generic checks**. One word, two bars.
//!
//! This module takes the product doc's bar, because it is the document titled
//! *Supported stacks and support levels* and because the difference is visible
//! to a user: [`SupportLevel::plain_description`] renders `Generic` as *"SURE
//! can find how this project is built and run"*, and SURE cannot run it. The
//! other reading — that the level states what SURE **understands**, discovery's
//! grade is the whole answer, and the ceiling should be `Generic` — is a real
//! one, it is the owner's to settle, and it is a two-line change here plus the
//! tests that pin today's answer.
//!
//! **Where the level and the grade disagree, the reason says both**, so the
//! report never reconciles them by silence. See [`what_sure_can_do`].
//!
//! # What it does not do
//!
//! **It does not read anything.** It is a view over a [`Discovery`], so it
//! cannot disagree with the discovery it came from about what was in the
//! project — and a caller may classify a discovery whose directory has since
//! been deleted. `a_classification_survives_the_project_being_deleted` holds
//! that.
//!
//! **It does not decide whether the project is good.** It says how far SURE's
//! support reaches; whether the project's own declarations are honest is what
//! the checks after it are for.
//!
//! **It does not consult the execution mode or the permissions — and since
//! `P18-T007` that is a decision rather than a consequence.** A grant says what
//! the user *allowed*; a level says what SURE can *do*. Those two came apart when
//! the runner was wired: a granted run **can** run approved generic checks, and
//! the ceiling stays at `InspectOnly` anyway, because level B is a claim about
//! every platform SURE runs on and one platform has not earned it for both. A
//! level that moved with a settings file would be a level that says what the
//! person had allowed rather than what the build can do, and it would make the
//! same project read as two different levels on two runs. What a permission
//! cannot do is make a check exist that was never written, which is the part of
//! the old sentence that was always about the level.
