//! P14-T011's acceptance, measured over the real corpus.
//!
//! > *Produces machine-readable acceptance report against
//! > `evaluation/acceptance-manifest.json`.*
//!
//! and the sentence `evaluation/README.md:5` states the quality bar in:
//!
//! > *The release report must include actual observed outcome for every case.*
//!
//! # What this file is
//!
//! It is the runner §3 of the brief asks for. `sure_core::acceptance_report`
//! holds the report's shape and one recipe per case; this file drives it over
//! `evaluation/acceptance-manifest.json` and `fixtures/adversarial/`, writes the
//! document to `target/tmp/acceptance-report.json`, and asserts the properties a
//! reader has to be able to rely on without re-reading any of it.
//!
//! # The one observation this file makes and the module cannot
//!
//! `repair-regression` is measured by running the fixture's two node checks
//! against a copy of the project and driving the repair lifecycle over the
//! results — the drive `repair_fixture_e2e.rs` makes in full. A `src` module
//! cannot do it: `crates/sure-core/tests/spawn_sites.rs`'s rule two forbids any
//! file under `crates/**/src/**` outside `MAY_NAME_A_PROCESS_REQUEST` from naming
//! a `ProcessRequest`, and `sure_core::support`'s ceiling of level C rests on no
//! product path running project code. So the module reports the case
//! `cannot_confirm` with that rule written into the row, and this file measures
//! it and supplies the measurement through
//! `acceptance_report_with` — which is why the row's `surfaces` name this file
//! and not a module of the product.
//!
//! # What this file does not do
//!
//! It opens no store (`store: None` everywhere), it never writes into
//! `fixtures/` or `evaluation/`, and every copy it runs is taken under
//! `target/tmp` and removed again. `fixtures/adversarial/repair-regression` is
//! read and copied; nothing in it is modified.
//!
//! # Where the report goes
//!
//! `target/tmp/acceptance-report.json`. `.gitignore` covers `/target/`, so the
//! document is a build artefact rather than a tracked file: it is a reading of
//! this checkout on this day, and a committed one would be a document that goes
//! stale in a way nothing reddens. `cargo clean` removes it, which is the right
//! lifetime for a measurement — re-running this test regenerates it.
//!
//! # The gate written beside it
//!
//! `the_release_gate_over_this_report_permits_the_release_and_is_written_beside_it`
//! writes `target/tmp/release-gate.json` — P14-T012's document, which the P15
//! packaging tasks read — from this same report, because the gate must be taken
//! from the report the release is judged on and this is the report that carries
//! the one measurement no `src` module can make.
