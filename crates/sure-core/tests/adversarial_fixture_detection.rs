//! The TypeScript adversarial fixtures make the scanners say what they claim.
//!
//! `P14-T001`'s acceptance is one sentence:
//!
//! > *Fake payment/auth/email/dead button/route/demo cases runnable with
//! > expected outcomes.*
//!
//! A fixture directory and a `scenario.json` prove nothing on their own. The
//! files under `fixtures/adversarial/*/` are inputs, and the claim each one
//! makes is that **SURE's own scanners fire on it** — that the defect is
//! discoverable by the product as it is, not by a reader with the README open.
//! This file is that claim, checked against the real scanners reading the real
//! fixture directories.
//!
//! # Why the fixtures are read from the checkout rather than rebuilt in a temp
//! # directory
//!
//! Every other test in this crate writes its project into `target/tmp` so the
//! test owns it. These five scanners are being asked about **the fixtures the
//! product ships**, and a copy would be a different project the day someone
//! edits one and not the other. The directory is the artefact; reading it where
//! it lives is what makes this test able to fail when the artefact stops
//! working.
//!
//! # What is paired with what
//!
//! A scanner that reported everything would satisfy every "this fixture fires"
//! assertion in this file, so each positive assertion is paired with a negative
//! one drawn from the same fixture:
//!
//! - `route-mismatch` declares `/api/health` and *calls* `/api/health`, and the
//!   route checker must stay silent about it while reporting `/api/orders`. A
//!   checker that flagged every frontend path would pass the positive half for
//!   the wrong reason.
//! - `demo-analytics` must produce exactly the four demo-data categories. A
//!   module that flagged every literal would produce them among a crowd.
//! - A project holding none of these patterns must produce nothing at all from
//!   all five scanners, which is the control the whole file rests on.
//!
//! # The Python half, and how it differs
//!
//! `P14-T002` added `missing-migration`, `external-unverified` and
//! `missing-config` under the same directory. They are not driven by the five
//! scanners above; each one fires a different module, and the differences are
//! the point:
//!
//! - `missing-migration` fires [`sure_core::db_migrations`], the only check in
//!   this file whose evidence is `EvidenceClass::ObservedFact` rather than
//!   `Inference`. It reaches `Severity::MustFix` on that observed fact, not
//!   through [`sure_core::finding_gravity`], and it is asserted rather than
//!   assumed.
//! - `external-unverified` fires [`sure_core::external_service`], whose
//!   proposal is `Severity::ShouldFixFirst` with `critical = true` — heavier
//!   than the manifest's `note`, and *not* filed as style noise, because
//!   `is_style_noise` moves only `Note` candidates. What the manifest actually
//!   asks for here is the *outcome*, `cannot_confirm`/`not_checked`, and that is
//!   what `ExternalServiceChecks::not_checked` produces.
//! - `missing-config` fires [`sure_core::env_completeness`] over
//!   [`sure_core::references`]. It has **no case in
//!   `evaluation/acceptance-manifest.json`**, which its `scenario.json` records,
//!   and its severity is asserted against the detector rather than against the
//!   manifest because there is no manifest line to assert it against.
//!
//! # The claim-evidence half, and how it differs
//!
//! `P14-T004` added `tests-not-run`, `stale-test-evidence` and
//! `unknown-evidence` under the same directory. They fire no scanner: each is a
//! **recording** — a claim an AI made and the harness events behind it — and the
//! recording is declared in the fixture's own `scenario.json` as the event
//! documents a harness would send. What is compared here is what SURE says about
//! it, and the three differences from the halves above are the point:
//!
//! - The input is the fixture's own declarations, ingested through
//!   [`sure_core::harness_event::ingest_event_str`] — the entry point a harness's
//!   JSON takes — and stored through the session event store, so a document the
//!   wire refuses is a failing test rather than a document nobody checked.
//! - Every fact asserted comes out of the scenario rather than being restated
//!   here: the assessment, the sentence a reader is shown, the number of
//!   evidence items, the anchor, the class and the freshness are all compared
//!   against the `expect` block, and the rendered `AI claims` section is compared
//!   whole. A fixture edited without this file being edited is a red test.
//! - Each is read twice — once through the store, which is what `sure check`
//!   reads, and once through [`check_claims_against_events`] over the same events
//!   in the order that function documents — and the two answers must be equal.
//!
//! And each has a control: the same recording with exactly one field of one event
//! moved, whose answer must be `confirmed`. That is the one control this half
//! cannot do without. A checker that answered `cannot_confirm` to everything
//! would satisfy all three of these fixtures' required outcomes at once, and the
//! corpus would look green while measuring nothing; the controls are what make
//! the three answers a measurement of the recordings rather than of the checker.
//!
//! # What is not claimed
//!
//! **A severity of its own, for the six TypeScript fixtures.** No scanner in
//! this file holds one. What each emits is [`sure_core::finding_gravity`]'s
//! answer for the gap it found and the reach it found it on: `must_fix` for a
//! substituted action in production code, `should_fix_first` for unreal content,
//! `note` for an unfinished marker and for anything that names nothing, points
//! at a place a reader cannot open, rests on an `Unknown` result, or cannot
//! reach a user. Until `P7-T011` every scanner here emitted `Severity::Note`,
//! `critical = false`, `EvidenceClass::Inference` — the combination
//! [`sure_core::false_completion_aggregator`] filed as style noise — while
//! `evaluation/acceptance-manifest.json` asked for `must_fix` on five of those
//! six ids. The test that recorded that gap was
//! `what_is_detected_is_not_yet_what_the_manifest_requires`;
//! [`what_is_detected_now_carries_the_weight_the_manifest_requires`] is that
//! test inverted, and the sentence is kept in both places because it is the only
//! statement in the tree that the two numbers were ever different.
//!
//! **A raised evidence class.** The severity moved and the class did not:
//! `EvidenceClass::Inference` is what every one of these findings' own
//! `scenario.json` requires, and it is what they still report. A scanner that
//! reached `must_fix` by presenting its inference as a fact would be relabelling
//! rather than grading, and [`sure_core::finding_gravity`]'s own tests refuse
//! that move.
//!
//! **A verdict.** These are candidates. `CheckProposal::severity` is how bad it
//! would be if the check is not satisfied, and no scanner here sets `critical`,
//! so a `must_fix` candidate decides nothing about whether a project passes —
//! what it decides is whether the candidate is shown rather than filed as noise.
//! The weight was not free: `noop_heuristics`' hard-coded-success shape and
//! `ui_action_bridge`'s declared-handler shape both occur in ordinary, working
//! code, and they are now weighted as if a user's money or their primary action
//! is behind them. That cost is deliberate and is recorded at the detectors.
//!
//! **A password check that is always true.** SURE has no detector that reads
//! `verifyPassword` returning `true` as an authentication bypass.
//! `fake-auth` fires on what surrounds the bypass, and
//! `fake_auth_is_detected_by_what_surrounds_the_bypass` says which parts, so a
//! reader does not take the passing test for a capability SURE does not have.
//!
//! **A Python integration that imports its provider.** Two limits of
//! [`sure_core::external_service`] are measured here rather than described:
//! `import stripe` in a `.py` file and `stripe==11.0.0` in `requirements.txt`
//! each produce no proposal at all, because the import and dependency tables are
//! JavaScript-shaped. `external-unverified` fires on its `STRIPE_` environment
//! prefix, and `a_python_provider_import_on_its_own_is_not_detected` holds that
//! difference so nobody reads the passing assertion above as a capability this
//! check does not have.

// --- the intent fixtures -------------------------------------------------

// scanner and ship no recording: each is a **project**, small and honest, plus
// an intent supplied in-process through `sure_core::project_intent::explicit_goal`
// — the door the `--goal` flag goes through. What is compared here is what SURE
// says when it puts the two together, and the two halves are the two acceptance
// sentences:
//
// - with no intent at all, SURE may claim nothing about fulfilment, and the
//   report carries the frozen sentence. That half is **swept**, not
//   spot-checked: a gate written to answer `false` for nothing at all would pass
//   a check at zero and would be measuring nothing.
// - with an explicit goal nothing implements, SURE may say so — once, at the
//   level the gravity rule allows, and no further. The fixture pins both the
//   level and the ceiling above it, because a fixture that recorded only "it is
//   a note today" would leave the next person free to raise it.
//
// Each half carries a control that must reach the opposite answer, because the
// failure this task exists to catch is not a wrong answer: it is a reporter that
// says `cannot_confirm` to everything, or `requirement not met` to everything.
// Either would satisfy the positive half and would measure nothing.
//
// The projects ship no language manifest, for the reason the claim fixtures ship
// none: `every_runnable_fixture_directory_is_named_in_this_file` in

// appears, and these are graded from a `Discovery` rather than by running

// --- P14-T013: the corpus's record of what the detectors produce -------------
//
// Two fields in a `scenario.json` look alike and are not. `required_severity` is
// **the requirement**, it belongs to `evaluation/acceptance-manifest.json`, and
// no task that measures the product may move it — a corpus edited to agree with
// the code is the false green this repository exists to catch, one level up.
// `detector_severity_today` is **the corpus's record of the detectors**, and
// `P7-T011` moved the detectors out from under it: every false-completion
// scanner in this file used to write `Severity::Note` into its own category
// table and now asks [`sure_core::finding_gravity`], so twenty-five of the
// thirty-seven rows that carry the field recorded a severity no detector
// produces any more.
//
// Nothing noticed for two days, and the reason is the one worth keeping in
// mind: `grep -rn detector_severity_today crates/` returned one prose line in
// `sure-core/src/acceptance_report.rs` and nothing else. A field no `.rs` file
// reads cannot be contradicted by one, which is exactly why it could go stale.
// After `P14-T013` it is read by the test below, and the two lists this header
// used to imply — what the corpus says the detectors do, and what they do — are
// compared rather than assumed equal.
//
// # What the test below does, and the two arms it has
//
// It walks `fixtures/adversarial/*/scenario.json` — discovered, not named, so a
// fixture that grows a `detector_severity_today` is checked without this file
// being edited — reads each document's own text, runs the detector that
// document's `surface` and `detector` name over the fixture the document lives
// in, and compares. There is no list of expected severities here: such a list
// would be a *second* place to keep the same fact, and this file is the first
// place that would then have to be kept in step with two others.
//
// A row either carries `detector_severity_today`, which the test checks, or
// `detector_severity_measured_by`, which names the test that measures the value
// instead — the acceptance's own alternative wording, for a value no in-process
// detector call can reach. Exactly one row uses the second arm, and the test
// asserts that it is exactly one, so the weaker arm cannot quietly spread:
// `rust-tests-fail`'s `project_verdict` outcome is about what a *run* of that
// fixture aggregates to, and running it means the four `cargo` invocations
// `crates/sure-core/tests/rust_fixture_apps.rs` already pays for in its own
// test. The second arm is checked rather than trusted: the file the statement
// names must be there and must contain the test it names, so renaming or
// deleting the test that owns the measurement reddens this one.
//
// # The mutation this test is built to catch
//
// The way this test could pass while measuring nothing is not a missing
// assertion but a comparison that agrees by construction. So the mutation is
// written down to be run, in the pattern
// `crates/sure-core/tests/acceptance_report_runner.rs` uses for its own
// anti-vacuity halves. **Reproducible mutation, and the one this test is for:**
// in `fixtures/adversarial/dead-button/scenario.json`, put
//
//     "detector_severity_today": "note",
//
// back on the first `required_outcomes` entry — the `ui_action_bridge` one,
// whose detector reaches `must_fix` — and then run
//
//     cargo test -p sure-core --test adversarial_fixture_detection
//
// This test goes red and its failure message names the fixture, the surface and
// both severities. It was run, not predicted, and run again over the whole
// workspace: `cargo test --workspace --all-features --no-fail-fast` reported 78
// passing targets and this one, so no other test in the tree reads the field —
// which is the same silence that let it go stale, measured rather than assumed.
// The run's own output is at `target/tmp/p14t013-mutation.txt`. The second
// mutation, which measures the comparison rather than the corpus, is to replace
//
//     produced.iter().all(|severity| *severity == recorded)
//
// with `!produced.is_empty()` below; the whole point of the equality is that a
// detector that produced *something* would satisfy the weaker form.

///

// --- P15-T028: what a report run leaves in the tree it drives -----------------
//
// `sure_core::acceptance_report` drives machinery over the shipped fixtures, and
// one of its recipes — `execution_refusal`, the case `dynamic-not-authorized` —
// needs a configuration root, because the file that asks for execution and
// cannot grant it is the fixture's own `sure.yaml`. That root used to be made
// inside the fixture being measured:
//
//   fixtures/adversarial/dynamic-not-authorized/target/tmp/
//     acceptance report configuration/{config,data}
//
// Five directories, every one of them empty, and invisible: git describes a
// directory only through the files inside it, and a directory holding no file
// has none, so `git status --untracked-files=all` reports a tree holding them as
// clean — as does every other setting. They were on disk on every machine that
// had run this report, and the next run over that fixture measured a project the
// previous one had put them in.
//
// This is the check that a run adds nothing to that tree. It has two
// instruments, and they watch for different shapes:
//
// - [`tree_paths`] walks the fixture and reads back EVERY directory and file
//   under it. It is the only instrument here that can see a directory at all,
//   and an empty directory is precisely the shape this case's residue had.
// - `git status --untracked-files=all` is run over the same path. It is the
//   instrument that watches for a FILE, which is the shape git can describe and
//   the shape the residue becomes the moment anything writes into the
//   configuration root this recipe hands to `Paths::from_roots` — the one event
//   that would turn an invisible directory into a change to a tracked tree.
//
// It watches two trees, because on this machine one of them is blind and the
// reason is worth stating rather than leaving a reader to find:
//
// - **The shipped fixture**, with a report run over the real corpus. This is the
//   tree the case is about. It already holds the five directories described
//   above, left there by builds before this change, so a run that re-created
//   them would add nothing to this walk and the walk could not tell such a run
//   from one that leaves nothing. What the shipped tree holds beyond a checkout
//   of it is printed below as a READING and not asserted, because removing it is
//   not this check's to do: a check that deleted inside a shipped fixture tree
//   would be doing to that tree exactly what this change stops the module doing,
//   and nothing in this repository writes there.
// - **A fresh checkout of the corpus** under `target/tmp`, built from the files
//   git tracks — which is every file a checkout of this repository has, and none
//   of the directories the residue is made of, because git tracks neither. A
//   report is run over that tree as well, and this is the instrument that
//   reddens when the scratch moves back under `fixtures_root`: nothing has ever
//   been run over it, so anything a run leaves there is new to it.
//
// The two runs' rows for the case are compared as well. The case has to measure
// the same thing in a tree a report has been run over and in one it has not,
// which is the other half of what the residue would have cost.
//
// Both readings are printed, so `cargo test -- --nocapture` shows what each
// instrument saw on a green run as well as on a red one.
