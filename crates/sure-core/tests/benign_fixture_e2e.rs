//! The benign false-positive corpus, graded by measurement rather than by shape.
//!
//! `P14-T010`'s acceptance is one sentence:
//!
//! > *Test mocks/examples/docs TODOs do not become indiscriminate must-fix
//! > findings.*
//!
//! Two weaker readings of that sentence pass without measuring anything, and
//! this file is built to refuse both.
//!
//! The first is **silence**. A report that says `No open findings.` about a
//! project because nothing read it is the false green this whole product exists
//! to catch, and a corpus of benign files satisfies *do not become must-fix* by
//! being invisible just as well as it does by being graded. So every assertion
//! here is a positive one: a named file in `fixtures/adversarial/benign-test-mocks/`
//! is read by a named detector, and what comes out is the level the corpus
//! declares. The five files were chosen so that each of the five candidate
//! detectors has exactly one home, and `CandidateScanner`, `NoOpHeuristics` and
//! `DemoDataHeuristics` each report **at most one proposal per category per
//! project** — anchored at the first matching file in sort order — which is why
//! exactly one file in the corpus carries the word `mock` and exactly one
//! carries `TODO`. A second benign file carrying the same word would not be
//! measured here, and the corpus's `notes` records that limit rather than
//! leaving it to be discovered.
//!
//! The second weak reading is **a harmless gap kind**. `UnfinishedMarker` is
//! capped one level below `must_fix` by `sure_core::finding_gravity` whatever
//! the path says, so a corpus of TODOs, mock words and placeholders would
//! satisfy the acceptance without the context gate ever being asked a question.
//! The corpus therefore carries one file whose gap kind is `SubstitutedAction`
//! — the only kind the gravity rule ever lifts to `must_fix` — and the third
//! control takes the file-name convention away from it and measures what
//! happens. That control is the boundary of the acceptance rather than a
//! contradiction of it: the case is about *test mocks, examples and docs
//! TODOs*, and the control is what the same bytes answer outside them.
//!
//! # What is read from where
//!
//! The shipped directory is read where it lives, for the reason
//! `adversarial_fixture_detection.rs` gives: the directory is the artefact, and
//! a copy would be a different project the day someone edits one and not the
//! other. The three controls are **copies** under the workspace's git-ignored
//! `target/tmp`, each with exactly the changes its own `scenario.json` declares
//! — and the filesystem is compared against that declaration afterwards, so a
//! control that altered more than it says is a failing test rather than a
//! silent extra variable.
//!
//! Nothing here opens a store and nothing here writes to one. Discovery and the
//! five detectors are pure functions of a directory, so grading this corpus
//! leaves the machine's SURE data exactly as it found it.
//!
//! # What is not claimed
//!
//! **A verdict.** These are candidates. `CheckProposal::severity` is what a
//! check would carry if it were not satisfied; none of the five detectors sets
//! `critical`, so nothing here decides whether the project passes. The
//! aggregate is asserted to hold nothing *material* — not to hold nothing.
//!
//! **A severity calibration.** This file records what the product produced on
//! the day it was written. `P7-T011` owns the argument about which level is
//! right for which gap, and `finding_severity_rule.rs` owns the sweep that holds
//! every fixture's measured severity against the release manifest.
//!
//! **That a `false_positive` declaration is enforced.** The corpus's
//! `forbidden_outcomes` use two kinds, and `false_positive` is prose: nothing in
//! the tree reads it as a rule. What holds the level is the `control` blocks
//! below, which assert the severity the product actually produces, and the
//! `status` outcome, which asserts the aggregate. `fixture_apps.rs` reads the
//! `false_green` entries and requires one of them, because that kind is the
//! release rule; the other is written down for a reader.
