//! `P4-T001`'s acceptance, checked rather than asserted.
//!
//! The task's sentence is:
//!
//! > *Ordered plan includes reason, evidence class and execution requirements
//! > per check.*
//!
//! Three claims in one sentence, and they are not the same kind of claim. That
//! each entry *carries* a reason, an evidence class and its requirements is
//! behavioural — it is checked here from outside the crate, which is also what
//! proves the accessors are public and the seam is usable. That the plan is
//! *ordered* is a property rather than a value, so it is checked against the
//! rules the module states rather than against one expected list. And that the
//! ordering does not depend on how the checks arrived cannot be demonstrated by
//! running one case at all, so it is a sweep.
//!
//! # The five rules
//!
//! **One: the acceptance sentence, over a plan and not over one proposal.**
//! Every entry, with the reason, the evidence class and the requirements read
//! back through the public API.
//!
//! **Two: the order is the rules' order, whatever order the proposals arrived
//! in.** Every permutation of a four-check set, built from outside the crate,
//! lands on the same sequence — and that sequence is asserted to be the one the
//! three rules describe, so a stably wrong plan fails too.
//!
//! **Three: nothing in the product proposes a check except where it is allowed
//! to.** No shipped file outside [`MAY_PROPOSE`] names [`CheckProposal`],
//! [`CheckReason`], [`ExecutionRequirements`] or [`PlanBuilder`]. **This rule was
//! meant to fail, and it did**: it was written before any proposer existed, it
//! fired on `P4-T002`, and that commit named `src/checks/node.rs` in the
//! exemption with its reason — which is the moment this paragraph said somebody
//! would read it. The rule survives the failure rather than being deleted,
//! because what it now holds is the thing that is still true: a file that begins
//! proposing checks is a decision, and the list is where the decision is written
//! down. `every_exemption_from_the_proposer_rule_is_still_a_proposer` is the
//! other half — an exemption whose file has stopped naming any of the four words
//! is a hole in the rule rather than an exception to it, and it fails too.
//!
//! **Four: the schedule cannot spell a verdict.** The shipped part of
//! `schedule.rs` names `CheckStatus` zero times, and `CheckResult` four times in
//! four roles — a doc sentence, an import, one signature and one call. The
//! status a blocked check gets is the domain's `not_run` constructor's to choose,
//! so there is no place here where a schedule entry could be turned into a pass.
//!
//! **Five: the frozen plan does not grow a reason.** `CheckPlan` in
//! `sure-domain/src/vocabulary.rs` holds identifiers and nothing else, and the
//! reason and the evidence class this task adds live in `sure-core`. That
//! boundary is the reason `Enforcement` did not have to change for this task, and
//! a field appearing in the domain record is an ADR-level decision rather than a
//! refactor.
//!
//! # What is not claimed here
//!
//! **None of this says a check is a good one.** The schedule will faithfully
//! order and carry a check that is worthless, or one whose evidence class is a
//! lie, and rules one to five are silent about it — the same limit `browser.rs`
//! states about its drivers. What they hold is that the plan a report is built
//! from cannot be quietly incomplete in the two ways that matter: a check dropped
//! for being unrunnable, and an order that depends on somebody's loop.
