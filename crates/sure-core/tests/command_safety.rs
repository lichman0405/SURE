//! `P3-T004` acceptance: *"Static/read-only, dynamic host, install, network,
//! destructive categories are distinct."*
//!
//! "Distinct" is the whole of the acceptance sentence, and distinctness is a
//! property of *pairs* — so the test below is a matrix rather than five
//! assertions. For every ordered pair of categories there is a command line that
//! carries the first and not the second, which is what makes the five of them
//! five rather than one ladder with five names.
//!
//! The matrix is written against **single-class witnesses**: one command per
//! category that falls into that category and no other. That is the stronger
//! form of the same statement — if every category has a command that carries it
//! alone, then no two categories can be a relabelling of one another — and it is
//! also the form that fails loudly when a category is added to
//! `CommandClass::ALL` without a command that reaches it.
//!
//! The second half of the file is the other direction: the categories are only
//! worth having if the commands SURE does not understand are kept out of them.
//! `Static` is the one every mistake would land on, so the tests below name
//! every way a command can escape this table's knowledge and check that none of
//! them reads as read-only.
