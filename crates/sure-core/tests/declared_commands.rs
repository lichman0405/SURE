//! A declared check SURE cannot run is a check with an answer, and the answer
//! reaches the verdict.
//!
//! `P18-T011`'s clause two is two sentences: *"A critical result that is not a
//! pass blocks green, and an unreported critical check does too."* The second
//! half has a shape that is easy to miss, because the check *was* reported —
//! `MissingCommand::not_checked` builds the row, and its unit test asserts the
//! scope-limit split that decides whether the row blocks. What was wrong was one
//! layer out: `aggregate_run` walked the schedule, a declared check was never
//! proposed so its id was never in the schedule, and the row was left over in
//! `RunReport::unscheduled` — a field documented as *"reported and not
//! aggregated"* that **no renderer and no product path reads**.
//!
//! So the value's own test passed while the product dropped the value, which is
//! the purest form of the false green this repository is built against: a
//! property proved about a value nothing gives a chance to matter.
//!
//! # What this file holds, and what it does not
//!
//! Every assertion below is made **through the pipeline** rather than against
//! `MissingCommand` directly, because the defect was never in the type. The
//! fixture is a manifest with one script a runner can carry out, one declaration
//! no runner accepts, and one name with no value at all, and the run is
//! `sure check`'s own — discovered, planned, enforced, aggregated, summarised.
//!
//! **The mode is inspecting, so nothing in this fixture is executed.** The
//! runner is the product's own with its cancellation already asked for, so a
//! check that somehow reached it would come back as an error rather than as a
//! process. Nothing here needs a runner to work; it needs a pipeline to finish.
//!
//! # What is not claimed
//!
//! **Not that the manifest is read the way a package manager reads it.** SURE's
//! own reader decides what `"test": ["jest"]` is, and that decision is
//! `crates/sure-core/src/discover/node.rs`'s and is tested there. What is
//! measured here is what happens to the answer afterwards.
