//! Finding out what a Python project declares.
//!
//! P2-T005 acceptance:
//!
//! > Detects dependency files, virtualenv/package-manager choice, declared test
//! > and lint tooling, and framework usage.
//!
//! `docs/architecture/ECOSYSTEM_DISCOVERY.md` is the authority for what is
//! asserted here, and its "Enforced by" table is the index from a statement to
//! the test below that holds it.
//!
//! # Why these tests build real projects
//!
//! Every criterion is about reading files a person wrote, and the parts that can
//! be unit-tested — the tables, the accessors, the rules — already are, in
//! `src/discover/python.rs`. What is left, and what only a real directory can
//! answer, is whether discovery finds the files at all: whether the walk lists
//! them, whether a file it could not read is reported instead of being treated
//! as a file that is not there, and whether a directory that is not a Python
//! project is left alone.
//!
//! # The two properties most of this file is about
//!
//! **A manifest that could not be read is not a manifest that is absent.** A
//! project whose `pyproject.toml` failed to parse declares no dependencies, no
//! tooling and no entry points — and so does a project with no `pyproject.toml`
//! at all. Reporting the second when the first is true is a false statement
//! about the project, and it is the failure `CLAUDE.md` ranks above a visible
//! error. Several tests below exist only to hold that line.
//!
//! **Discovery at this stage runs nothing.** `setup.py` is a Python *program*,
//! and this is the ecosystem where "reading the manifest" could most easily turn
//! into running the project. One test writes a `setup.py` that would leave a
//! file behind if anything executed it, and checks that no such file appears.
