//! Finding out what a Rust project declares.
//!
//! P2-T006 acceptance:
//!
//! > Detects Cargo workspaces/packages and conventional commands.
//!
//! `docs/architecture/ECOSYSTEM_DISCOVERY.md` is the authority for what is
//! asserted here, and its "Enforced by" table is the index from a statement to
//! the test below that holds it.
//!
//! # Why these tests build real projects
//!
//! Every criterion is about reading files a person wrote, and the parts that can
//! be unit-tested — the tables, the accessors, the rules — already are, in
//! `src/discover/rust.rs`. What is left, and what only a real directory can
//! answer, is whether discovery finds the files at all: whether the walk lists
//! them, whether a file it could not read is reported instead of being treated
//! as a file that is not there, and whether a directory that is not a Rust
//! project is left alone.
//!
//! # The three properties most of this file is about
//!
//! **A manifest that could not be read is not a manifest that is absent.** A
//! project whose `Cargo.toml` failed to parse declares no dependencies, no
//! members and no targets — and so does an empty directory. Reporting the second
//! when the first is true is a false statement about the project, and it is the
//! failure `CLAUDE.md` ranks above a visible error. Several tests below exist
//! only to hold that line.
//!
//! **A `.rs` file is not a Rust project.** The marker list is short on purpose,
//! and this is the ecosystem where a lazy marker would be most tempting: a
//! directory holding one `.rs` file is a directory holding one `.rs` file, and
//! saying it is a Rust project would put a stack in a report that has none.
//!
//! **Discovery at this stage runs nothing.** `build.rs` is a Rust *program* that
//! Cargo compiles and runs before the crate, and this is the ecosystem where
//! "reading the manifest" could most easily turn into running the project. One
//! test writes a `build.rs` that would leave a file behind if anything executed
//! it, and checks that no such file appears.
