//! The promises `sure doctor` makes about itself, checked from outside the crate.
//!
//! `sure_core::doctor`'s module documentation makes four claims that its own
//! unit tests cannot hold it to, because each is about a boundary rather than
//! about a value:
//!
//! 1. it never reads the settings file;
//! 2. it never creates the store;
//! 3. it names this build by its number alone;
//! 4. it always says what it did not look at.
//!
//! The first is an *absence* — no run of the binary can demonstrate that a line
//! of code was never written — so it is checked against the source, the way
//! `cli_contract.rs` checks that only `output.rs` writes to a stream. The rest
//! are checked against what the public API returns, because a promise about the
//! shape of a report is only worth anything if the report a caller gets has that
//! shape.

// The workspace forbids `unwrap`, `expect` and `panic` in shipped code, because
// a panic is a message nobody chose. A test is the one place they are the point:
// the panic *is* the report, and it names the value that was wrong.
