//! Fingerprinting a project by reading it, and choosing between the two kinds.

//!
//! > Scoped content manifest is deterministic.
//! > Generated/vendor churn is excluded by documented rules.
//!
//! # Why these tests touch a real filesystem
//!
//! Both criteria are about a value that has to come out the same for one project
//! state and different for another, and there is no way to check that without
//! project states. A test over a synthetic digest would be a test of the digest
//! function, which has its own unit tests; what is unverified after those is
//! whether this walk, on this filesystem, on this platform, puts the same things
//! into it twice.
//!
//! So every test below writes real files and drives
//! [`sure_core::fingerprint::content_fingerprint`] or
//! [`sure_core::fingerprint::project_fingerprint`].
//!
//! # The fixture is deliberately not the one `fingerprint_git.rs` uses
//!
//! That file's `Repo` carries what the Git kind needs and this one does not: two
//! ways to make a commit with fixed dates, `core.longpaths` for the long-path
//! test, and a 14-line panic explaining that a machine without Git cannot run it.
//! Copying it here would be copying the wrong half — and, more to the point,
//! would make the two files fail for each other's reasons. What is shared is
//! [`sure_testkit::repository_root`], which is what decides *where* a fixture
//! goes, and that is the part that has to agree.
//!
//! # What this file cannot test, and says so
//!
//! **A symbolic link, on Windows.** The [`Contents::Link`] machinery is covered
//! on Unix. It is not covered on Windows, and that is a fact about this machine
//! rather than an oversight: `CreateSymbolicLinkW` needs Developer Mode or
//! administrator rights, and this development machine has neither. The same gap
//! with the same cause is recorded for the Git kind in `fingerprint_git.rs`, so
//! it is one missing cover rather than two.
//!
//! **A pipe, on Windows.** Not a filesystem entry there, so the walk cannot meet
//! one. Covered on Unix, where meeting one could hang a check.
//!
//! **A directory that cannot be listed.** [`FingerprintError::Unreadable`] from
//! the walk is not produced anywhere here: forcing it needs an ACL or a mode
//! change that would be state outside the fixture.
//!
//! [`Contents::Link`]: sure_core::fingerprint::content
