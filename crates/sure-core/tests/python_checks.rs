//! `P4-T003`'s acceptance, checked from outside the crate.
//!
//! The task's sentence is one sentence:
//!
//! > *Declared import/test/lint/type checks use available tools without silent
//! > package installation.*
//!
//! Like `node_checks.rs`, this file works over **real directories**: manifests
//! written to disk, the product's own discovery reading them, and the checks
//! layer standing on what the discovery found. The unit tests in
//! `checks/python.rs` hold the rules against hand-built discovery results; this
//! file holds that the rules are reachable — that a `pyproject.toml` a person
//! would actually write reaches them, that the identifiers are stable across two
//! independent readings, and that the TOML-to-tools path the unit tests skip is
//! the one the product runs.
//!
//! # What the acceptance's four words turn into, and why there are four
//!
//! `import`, `test`, `lint` and `type` are not four roles: three of them are
//! [`CommandRole`]s and `import` is not a role at all. `checks/python.rs` argues
//! that at length; the part this file has to hold is the consequence, which is
//! that **every role the acceptance names produces either a plan entry or a
//! skipped result** — a cover, not a count. A report that says nothing about
//! tests in a project that has no test tool is the failure this guards, and it is
//! invisible in a count.
//!
//! # The half of the sentence that is about installing
//!
//! *Without silent package installation* is the clause with teeth, and it is
//! checked here in the only two places it can be: **no check may need the
//! install permission**, and **the thing that does install must not be a check**.
//! The first is asked of the domain's own permission mapping rather than of this
//! module's table — a proposal's requirements are a set of [`ActionKind`]s, and
//! `ExecutionRequirements::blocked_by` says which permission those need. The
//! second is asked by looking for the install command anywhere in the schedule.
//!
//! What is *not* claimed here, and cannot be: that a check's command does no
//! environment work of its own inside the runner. SURE does not compose an
//! install and does not claim the runner never does.
