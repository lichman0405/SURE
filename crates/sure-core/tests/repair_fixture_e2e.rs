//! `P14-T009`'s acceptance, checked by repairing the fixture and re-running its
//! own checks.
//!
//! The task's sentence is one sentence, and it has two halves:
//!
//! > *Repair can close only with new passing evidence; regression variant
//! > blocked.*
//!
//! # What makes this file different from `repair_regression_guard.rs`
//!
//! `crates/sure-core/tests/repair_regression_guard.rs` already asserts both
//! halves, with `CheckResult`s built by hand. That is the right shape for a test
//! about the decision rule, and it is not evidence that anything can be
//! repaired: a result someone typed is a claim, not a measurement.
//!
//! Here the evidence is **real**:
//!
//! - [`discover`] reads `fixtures/adversarial/repair-regression` from the
//!   `package.json` on disk;
//! - [`NodeChecks`] turns the two members' declared `test` scripts into the two
//!   checks the plan holds;
//! - [`sure_core::process::run`] — the one place in this workspace that starts a
//!   program — runs each of them against a copy of the project, and each
//!   process's own exit code is what becomes its [`CheckResult`];
//! - a repair is applied **by writing the corrected bytes into the copy**, so
//!   the second run is over a project that is a different project;
//! - [`seed_rechecks`] reads the failing check off the finding's own anchor, so
//!   this file supplies no re-check list of its own;
//! - [`select_impacted_checks`] chooses what has to pass before the finding may
//!   close — and the check that catches the regression is chosen by *it*, not by
//!   this file;
//! - [`reconcile`] makes the decision, and [`aggregate_run`] with
//!   [`build_verdict`] and [`render_summary`] say what the run may claim.
//!
//! # Which re-check list this file supplies, since `P7-T012`
//!
//! None. The list is [`seed_rechecks`]'s answer, read off the finding's own
//! anchor, and it reaches [`RepairContract::from_finding`] the same way it does
//! from the live path — `crates/sure-core/src/pipeline.rs` seeds every contract
//! with that one function, so a rule that stopped reading a finding's anchor
//! would redden here as well as there. The refusal that function's caller has to
//! satisfy is untouched: `from_finding` still rejects an empty list, so a finding
//! nothing can observe is a contract nobody can write rather than one that closes
//! on nothing.
//!
//! So the failing check reaches the contract through the product's own rule
//! rather than through a literal here, and **every other** check that joins it is
//! selected by the product. The second half of this file's claim is exactly that
//! the check which catches the regression gets in that way.
//!
//! # What the binary does with this fixture, measured and not asserted here
//!
//! `sure check <copy of this fixture>` plans three checks and, under the default
//! mode, reports all three as not checked:
//!
//! ```text
//! 3 check(s) could not run or were skipped. 3 of them are critical.
//!   (start the project, run the tests in packages/billing, run the tests in packages/checkout)
//!   - run the tests in packages/checkout  (Checking this would have meant running
//!     your project's code, and you have not allowed that.) [critical]
//! ```
//!
//! Two of those three are this fixture's checks. The third is the probe
//! `crate::runtime_probes` builds from the root `start` script, and it is not in
//! this file's plan for a reason the selection rule states itself:
//! `crates/sure-core/src/repair_impact.rs` asks for a `DeterministicCheck`
//! before a check can be a regression check, and a probe's evidence class is
//! `ObservedFact` — so no plan this fixture can produce will ever add the probe
//! to a re-check list. What the binary does with the fixture is recorded in
//! `fixtures/adversarial/repair-regression/README.md` and in its `scenario.json`
//! rather than asserted here, because a process-level `sure check` is
//! `crates/sure-cli/tests/cli_contract.rs`'s subject and this file's subject is
//! the lifecycle.
//!
//! # What this file does not do
//!
//! It does not run the shipped directory, and it does not write to it: every run
//! happens on a copy under `target/tmp`, taken through SURE's own content
//! fingerprint and asserted equal to the shipped directory before anything
//! happens to it. It opens no store, so `sure.db` on this machine is untouched.
