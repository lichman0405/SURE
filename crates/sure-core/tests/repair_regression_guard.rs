//! Repair-regression guard.
//!
//! A repair that fixes the original issue but breaks something else must not be
//! accepted. SURE enforces this by expanding the repair contract's re-check list
//! with affected and regression checks from the schedule, and by refusing to
//! resolve a previous finding unless every selected re-check passes.
//!
//! This file is the mandatory `repair-regression` adversarial fixture's
//! **decision rule**, read from outside the module that implements it: the
//! project can never turn green while the regression check is failing. Its
//! `CheckResult`s are typed in here, which is the right shape for a test about
//! the rule and not evidence that anything can be repaired — this file used to
//! say of itself that it *is* the fixture, which was all there was to say while
//! `fixtures/adversarial/repair-regression/` held a 186-byte descriptor and
//! nothing else. `P14-T009` gave the directory a real npm workspace to be about
//! and `crates/sure-core/tests/repair_fixture_e2e.rs` to grade it, over checks
//! that really run and a project whose bytes really change. What is left here is
//! the half a synthetic result is good for: the rule stated sharply, including
//! the case where the regression check is selected and fails while every other
//! selected check passes. `the_fixture_status_is_implemented` holds this file
//! and that directory together.
