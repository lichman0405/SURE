//! `P14-T003`'s acceptance, checked by running the fixture pair.
//!
//! The task's sentence is one sentence:
//!
//! > *At least one Rust real-fail/real-pass project exercises
//! > discovery/execution/reporting.*
//!
//! # What "real-fail/real-pass" has to mean, and why both halves are assertions
//!
//! `fixtures/adversarial/rust-tests-fail` is a Rust project whose own check
//! genuinely fails, and `fixtures/adversarial/rust-tests-pass` is the same
//! project with one line corrected. They are each other's control, and the pass
//! half is not decoration: a checker that refused every Rust project would
//! satisfy every assertion the failing half can make. So the single line that
//! separates them is asserted as a value in
//! [`the_pair_is_the_same_project_apart_from_one_line`], not described in a
//! README, and the two verdicts are asserted to differ in
//! [`the_failing_half_fails_only_the_test_check_and_is_not_ready`] and
//! [`the_passing_half_passes_every_check_and_is_green`].
//!
//! # What "exercises" has to mean
//!
//! **SURE's own modules run against the fixture and produce the verdict.** Not a
//! README's account of what SURE would say, and not this file's opinion:
//!
//! - [`discover`] reads the fixture from the `Cargo.toml` on disk;
//! - [`RustChecks`] turns that reading into the four proposed checks, in the
//!   plan [`PlanBuilder`] builds for a host-confirmed run;
//! - [`sure_core::process::run`] — the one place in this workspace that starts a
//!   program — runs each of the four, and each check's own exit code is what
//!   becomes its [`CheckResult`];
//! - [`aggregate_run`] turns those results and the plan into the run's verdict;
//! - [`build_verdict`] and [`render_summary`] turn that into the sentence a
//!   person reads.
//!
//! `crates/sure-core/tests/rust_checks.rs` states in as many words that nothing
//! in it runs `cargo` and that its results are "built by this file standing in
//! for the runner", which is the right shape for a test about fingerprint
//! binding. This file is the other half of that sentence: the results here come
//! out of processes that really ran, and that difference is what this task adds.
//!
//! # Three traps this file keeps out of the checkout's own build
//!
//! **A fixture must not become a workspace member.** The root manifest lists its
//! members explicitly, and a deliberately failing project must not be among
//! them: `cargo test --workspace` would build it and run it, and the checkout's
//! own suite would then fail because a fixture is doing its job.
//! [`neither_half_is_a_member_of_this_workspace`] holds both halves of the
//! arrangement — the root members list, and the empty `[workspace]` table that
//! makes each fixture a workspace root of its own, which is the other answer
//! `cargo` offers and the one that leaves the root manifest untouched.
//!
//! **`cargo` writes next to the manifest it reads.** A `Cargo.lock` or a
//! `target/` inside a shipped fixture would appear in `git status`, because the
//! `.gitignore` entry for `target/` is anchored at the repository root. So
//! nothing here runs `cargo` in the fixture: every run happens on a copy under
//! `target/tmp`, and the copy is not taken on trust — [`content_fingerprint`],
//! SURE's own, is computed for the shipped directory and for the copy, and the
//! two digests are asserted equal. The failing half's tests also assert that the
//! shipped directory still has no lock file and no build directory afterwards.
//!
//! **A check's command is one string and the runner takes an argument vector.**
//! [`CheckReason::DeclaredCommand`] carries `cargo test` as a single `String`,
//! and `sure_core::process` splits nothing — its module documentation says so in
//! those words. The split therefore has to happen somewhere between the schedule
//! and the runner, and today that somewhere is [`request`] below, in a test,
//! because the composition layer that will own it does not exist yet. That is
//! recorded rather than hidden: the day a runner is written, this is the shape it
//! has to reproduce.
