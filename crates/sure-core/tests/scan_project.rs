//!
//! There is no test here for a directory the operating system refuses to list,
//! and none for a single directory entry the operating system fails to describe.
//! The first needs either a privileged user or an ACL change — `chmod 000` does
//! nothing when the tests run as root, and a test that passes because its premise
//! did not hold is worse than no test. The second needs an entry that cannot be
//! built at all. Both are covered as far as they can be inside
