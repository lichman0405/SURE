//! Support-level classification end to end, from the outside.
//!
//! `crate::support`'s own tests hold the rule's parts — the ordering, the fold,
//! the ceiling, the list. This file drives the whole thing through the public
//! API over real directories, which is where the parts have to add up to a
//! sentence a person can read and check.
//!
//! # What this file can and cannot observe today
//!
//! `sure_core::support::CEILING` is [`SupportLevel::InspectOnly`], so **every
//! project classifies as level C** and the composition `weakest(understood,
//! CEILING)` cannot be told apart from the ceiling alone by anything here. That
//! is stated rather than hidden: the tests below assert the level *and* the
//! reason, the reason names the reading that was capped, and
//! `weakest_picks_the_weakest_whatever_order_it_arrives_in` is what holds the
//! fold until a check exists to make it observable from outside. The day
//! `CEILING` rises, the level assertions here fail — which is what they are for.
