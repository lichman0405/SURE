//! The shape of `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and what that shape is for.
//!
//! `P15-T010`'s acceptance is one sentence:
//!
//! > *Windows is mandatory primary job; macOS/Linux core jobs mandatory;
//! > fmt/check/clippy/test/evals included appropriately.*
//!
//! That sentence is four claims about a file, and a file is the thing this
//! machine can check. `ci.yml` already carried the substance of all four when
//! this file was written; what it did not carry was anything that would
//! *notice* one of them leaving. This repository has paid for that class of
//! blindness: `scripts/check-non-windows.mjs`'s header records that `ci` was red
//! for **75 consecutive runs** while every local gate was green, and the census
//! is item 99 of `progress/HANDOFF.md`.
//!
//! # What this file proves, and what it cannot
//!
//! It reads the workflow as text and asserts the four properties, each with an
//! edit that must turn it red. It proves **what the file says**. It proves
//! **nothing** about whether the workflow is valid YAML, whether GitHub Actions
//! would accept it, whether any run has happened, or whether a run that happened
//! passed. A file that says the right thing is not a run that did the right
//! thing, and the 75-run streak is exactly those two being confused; the run
//! record lives in `progress/HANDOFF.md`, and the runner is GitHub.
//! `grep -rn '\.github' --include='*.rs' crates/` found no test that read these
//! workflows at all before this one.
//!
//! # The reader, and why it is line-based
//!
//! `crates/sure-cli/tests/winget_manifest.rs` reads its YAML the same way — as
//! lines — for the same reason: a YAML parser would be a new dependency, and the
//! properties here are about text a person edits by hand. What keeps a line
//! reader honest is that it reports what it found. Every rule is written so that
//! a reader that came back empty produces *violations rather than silence*:
//! `a_workflow_that_is_not_there_is_not_a_pass` feeds it nothing and requires it
//! to complain, and `the_reader_sees_the_jobs_that_are_there` fails if the jobs,
//! the runners or the commands were read as absent. The one thing it
//! deliberately cannot read is a `run: |` block; a step that used one is
//! reported as a fault rather than skipped, so a multi-line command cannot hide
//! from these rules.
//!
//! # The rules, and the reading each one freezes
//!
//! 1. **The workflow runs by itself** — triggered by `push` and by
//!    `pull_request`. A job no trigger reaches is not a mandatory job.
//! 2. **Windows is a job of its own** — some job runs on `windows-latest` and
//!    on nothing else. This is the reading "primary job" is taken in:
//!    `docs/adr/0007-windows-primary-development.md` makes Windows the primary
//!    development environment, and the Windows-only checks (the bootstrap
//!    validation, the PowerShell host) are a job rather than a step of a matrix
//!    leg. A reader who disagrees with that reading should change this rule on
//!    purpose, not discover it afterwards.
//! 3. **The core jobs are mandatory on all three platforms** — the job that runs
//!    the workspace's tests runs them on `windows-latest`, `macos-latest` and
//!    `ubuntu-latest`, and none of the three may leave.
//! 4. **No job is conditional and nothing is allowed to fail** — no job-level
//!    `if:`, and no `continue-on-error` at any level. A step-level `if:` is not
//!    this rule's business: `ci.yml` uses one to apply the Linux `sysctl` knob
//!    only on Linux, and that is how a platform-specific step is written.
//! 5. **The four command families are run** — `fmt`, `check`, `clippy` and
//!    `test`, each carrying the fragments that make it a gate rather than a
//!    report, in one command per family.
//! 6. **The evals are reached by that test command** — it is a whole-workspace
//!    `cargo test`, and `crates/sure-core/tests/acceptance_report_runner.rs`
//!    names `evaluation/acceptance-manifest.json`, declares no case with
//!    `#[ignore]`, and the manifest declares cases. The evals are plain
//!    `#[test]`s, so running them *is* what "included appropriately" means here;
//!    the release *metrics* of `docs/product/PRODUCT_EVALS.md` are computed from
//!    that same report by `sure_core::release_gate` and read by
//!    `scripts/Build-Release.*`, which is `P15-T011`'s subject and
//!    `release-dry-run.yml`'s file.
//!
//! # Two things that look like gaps and are not
//!
//! `ci.yml` never runs `scripts/check-non-windows.mjs`, and that is correct
//! rather than an omission: the script cross-compiles clippy for Unix targets
//! *from Windows*, and this workflow's `macos-latest` and `ubuntu-latest` matrix
//! legs compile those `cfg` arms natively. Adding it here would be a redundant
//! job, and `scripts/check-non-windows.mjs` says so in its own header.
//! `release-dry-run.yml` is `workflow_dispatch`-only on purpose — its own header
//! and `docs/development/GITHUB_WORKFLOW.md` say the two workflows answer
//! different questions — so nothing here asserts anything about it.
//!
//! # Why the assertions live in `sure-testkit`
//!
//! This crate already holds the checks that keep the repository's own shape in
//! place (`repository_shape.rs`, `integration_thinness.rs`), it runs on all
//! three platforms — so this check runs in every matrix leg it is about — and
//! nothing in the product depends on it.
//!
//! # The second file: `.github/workflows/release.yml` (`P15-T011`)
//!
//! `P15-T011`'s acceptance is two sentences of different kinds:
//!
//! > *Release workflow can produce artifacts without requiring marketplace
//! > publication.*
//! > *No automatic force/merge behavior.*
//!
//! The first is a capability with a restriction and the second is a
//! prohibition, and a prohibition is the easiest kind of claim to assert
//! **vacuously**. Both are properties of a file, so both are read here, by the
//! same reader and the same rules-shaped function as the rest of this file —
//! `release_violations` over `release.yml` and the `scripts/Assemble-Release.sh`
//! its release job runs. What it proves is what that file says: no run of
//! `release.yml` has happened, because `git tag` returns zero tags on this
//! repository and its only trigger is a dispatch naming a tag. The rules and the
//! reading each one freezes are in the section headed "release.yml" below.
//!
//! Two of the rules are about *order* rather than presence, because presence is
//! where a rule of this kind goes vacuous: the two existence checks have to come
//! **before** `gh release create` in the file (a check after the create is not a
//! gate), and each job's `cargo test --workspace` has to come before the
//! packaging command that refuses without the release gate that test writes.
