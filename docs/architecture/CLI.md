# The command line

`sure` is the universal surface: every user can run every check without
installing a harness plugin (`docs/adr/0004-thin-harness-integrations.md`), and
a harness that wants an active tool surface calls these commands rather than
reimplementing them.

P1-T008 built the framework: what SURE accepts, and how a result reaches a
person and a script. P1-T009 added the first command whose answer depends on
what it found; P1-T010 made `sure protocol` answer a caller that asks whether
the two can talk; the harness work added `sure hook ingest`; P12-T009 added
`sure mcp serve`; P7-T010 gave `check`, `recheck` and `repair` the pipeline
behind them. Eight commands do their work. The rest are recognised, and say so.

That pipeline is one orchestrator in `sure-core` — `sure_core::pipeline` —
running the twelve stages of `docs/architecture/CHECK_PIPELINE.md` in order. It
is the only path from these three commands into the engine: the CLI renders what
the orchestrator returns and calls no detector, aggregator or renderer of its
own. How far down the twelve stages a command goes is the whole of the difference
between them — `check` performs 1–10, `repair` continues to the repair contract,
`recheck` to the re-check — and the stages it does not perform are recorded as
`not part of this run` rather than omitted, so every run shows all twelve.

One exception is stated rather than hidden. To print *the checks that must pass
before this closes*, `crates/sure-cli/src/check.rs` asks
`sure_core::repair_impact::select_impacted_checks` for them, because that is the
function stage 12 hands to the lifecycle and a second derivation in the CLI is
how a sentence a person reads and a test the run applies come apart. It is a
call into the module that owns the rule, not a rule of the CLI's own.

P2-T010 gave `sure check` its first flag with an effect: `--goal TEXT` records
what the user asked for. It is the one place on this surface where a command
changes something the output does not contain, so it has its own section below —
and since P7-T010 the recorded goal is also what the run resolves its intent
from, so the run does not stop there.

P1-T012 added the surface's one global option that changes where something is
written: `--store-dir DIR` says which directory this run's record store lives in.
Its section below is short because the design is: the value comes from the
process's argument vector and from nowhere else.

## The commands

| Command | What it will do | In this build |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sure check [PATH] [--goal TEXT]` | check a project and report what it found | works: the pipeline, a per-stage record, and a verdict |
| `sure recheck [PATH]` | check again and compare with last time | works: the same run, carried on to the last stage, which compares it with what an earlier run left open |
| `sure repair [PATH]` | turn what was found into instructions an agent can act on | works: the same run, carried on to the repair-contract stage, one contract per finding. Each names the check that produced it and the further checks that must pass before it closes, and each is recorded, so the next run has something to compare against |
| `sure history [list\|show\|delete\|export]` | show what SURE has recorded | works, except `export`: the sessions this machine has recorded, one session's events, and the delete |
| `sure doctor` | report where SURE keeps its files on this machine, and what it found there | works |
| `sure config [paths\|show\|validate]` | show the settings in effect and which layer each came from | recognised, not implemented |
| `sure hook ingest` | record one event from a coding harness | works; for a pre-action event it also answers with the action SURE would take and a sentence saying why |
| `sure hook allow-once --tool NAME (--command WORDS \| --path PATH) [--project DIR] [--minutes N]` | record a one-time allowance for one request SURE would otherwise hold | works; SURE reads the settings in force and the tool name, and if together they leave a request naming that tool that this project could be held for, it writes the grant to its store and says which acts that covers, read off the settings in force at the moment it writes. If they leave none — the default configuration does, for every tool, and strict-on-its-own does for any tool that is not a read — it refuses, names the tool, and writes nothing, because a grant no matching request could spend is a promise SURE cannot keep. What the sentence offers with it is the change that would make the grant spendable — a setting, where a setting is what stands in the way — which for a tool whose action would change the project's own files is `execution.allow_project_write: true` in the user's own settings file, together with `protection.mode: strict` where the protection in force would otherwise allow the change outright; a project's `sure.yaml` cannot grant that permission, and the sentence says so. Where no setting in this build is the cause the sentence says that instead of naming one, because naming one would be advice to change the wrong thing — and there is no such tool in this build, so that arm is kept for a build in which a permission is once again out of reach rather than deleted. Either way the sentence says the request that spends it has to be one SURE *holds*, rather than promising that the next matching request is let through — see `docs/security/PROTECTION_MODE.md` |
| `sure explain [ID]` | explain one recorded result in plain language | recognised, not implemented |
| `sure mcp serve` | answer a coding harness that speaks the Model Context Protocol | works; each tool it exposes runs one command in this table and returns that command's own answer |
| `sure protocol [--speaks VERSION]` | say which harness protocol this build speaks, or whether it can talk to a caller that speaks one | works |
| `sure version` | print the version of this build | works |

Two options are global — accepted before or after the command name, because they
describe the run rather than the command: `--format human|json`, which the last
section of this document is about, and `--store-dir DIR`, which says where the
run's record store goes. A command line may name a store location whether or not
the command in it writes to the store: a location that is wrong is a wrong
command line, and finding that out only when a command happens to write would
make the same mistake a usage error in one invocation and a silent success in
another.

"Recognised, not implemented" is not a euphemism for a stub. The command parses
its arguments, decides it cannot do its job, **exits with status 3**, and says in
one sentence what it did not do. Nothing is half-done and nothing is reported as
done. `check`, `recheck`, `repair` and `history` have left that list; `sure
config` and `sure explain` are still on it, and so is `sure history export`,
which is one action of a command whose other three work.

Where a command is scheduled is `tasks/tasks.json`. That file is not quoted here
on purpose: a phase number in a message a user reads is a promise the command
cannot keep, and the phase a command is scheduled for is not the phase a user
cares about.

### Arguments arrive with the phase that can act on them

No command carries a flag that nothing yet honours. A grammar that accepts
`--deep` and ignores it teaches the user that SURE understood them when it did
not, and the output gives them no way to find out otherwise. This is the same
rule as `additionalProperties: false` on the event schema: an input SURE does
not act on must be a visible error, not a dropped one.

A path is accepted where the documented form has one, and defaults to the
current directory. An identifier is accepted where a command names something.
Both are optional in this build, because making one required is a decision about
the command's contract that belongs to the phase implementing it.

`--goal` on `sure check` is the first flag that is honoured rather than carried,
and it arrived with the phase that could act on it. It is deliberately not
optional-with-a-default: absent means "check the project", and present means
"check it against this". P7-T010 gave both paths their answer — the bare form
runs the pipeline, and a run with `--goal` records the goal and then runs the
same pipeline with the goal resolved as intent (stage 2).

## `sure doctor`

The first command whose answer depends on what it found, and therefore the first
place where the status carries news rather than the fact that SURE ran.

It reports the four paths SURE uses on this machine — evidence and history, the
settings directory, the settings file, and the record store — which of the two
store locations this run is using, what is at each of them, what is in the store
if there is one, whether `git` is on `PATH`, and everything wrong that it found.
It also prints **what it did not check**, always, because a report that stops at
what it found invites the reader to assume it looked everywhere.

The store location is one line, `store location`, because a path alone cannot say
whether the run is using the platform's own location or one a caller named — and
a caller who cannot tell a redirect that worked from one that was ignored will
debug the wrong thing. The two sentences are "the platform's own location for
this user" and "named for this run, not the platform's own"; the machine form
carries `details.places.store_location` as `"platform"` or `"caller"` and puts the
file itself in `details.places.store_file.path`. The other three paths are always
the platform's; naming a store directory moves the store and nothing else,
because a caller who points the store somewhere has not asked SURE to read a
different configuration.

Three things it deliberately does not do, each of which is what makes the report
safe to paste into a bug report:

- **It does not read the settings file.** It reports the path and whether
  something is there. `docs/architecture/DIAGNOSTICS.md` requires that a secret
  never have to be handled in order to be reported, and the way to keep that true
  is never to open the file that may hold one. Reading settings is `sure config
  show`.
- **It does not create the store.** A store that is not there is reported as
  nothing recorded yet. A diagnostic that changes what it is diagnosing is worse
  than one that says it did not look.
- **It does not run a program.** Finding a program on `PATH` is an observed fact
  about the filesystem; running it is a different claim, and SURE has no process
  runner yet. This is one of the entries under "What this did not check", so a
  reader cannot mistake one for the other.

`sure doctor` is also the first command whose status is not the same on every
machine: 0 when it found nothing wrong, 1 when it did. That is the false-green
rule applied to SURE's own installation — `sure doctor || fix it` has to work.

## `sure history`

The command the two harness integrations had been telling people to run since
before it existed. It answers about **this machine**, not about a project: what
SURE has recorded here, and how to be rid of it. `sure history` and
`sure history show` never create the store — a machine where nothing has been
recorded answers "SURE has recorded nothing on this machine yet" rather than
printing an empty table, because an empty table and a store SURE could not read
would otherwise look the same.

| Form | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `sure history` | every session SURE has recorded, most recently recorded first, with the project and harness each came from and how long it is kept. `--limit N` shortens the listing; the count of what there is stays the count |
| `sure history show ID` | one session and the events in it, each with the record it wrote |
| `sure history delete --all\|--session ID\|--project ROOT` | removes the rows the scope names, and says how many of each |
| `sure history export` | not implemented in this build: status 3 |

**The scope on the command line is the consent.** Nothing prompts, so a delete
is scriptable by construction: exactly one of `--all`, `--session` and
`--project` is required. Naming none or two is a usage error (status 2) rather
than a default, and a delete with no scope can never be read as a delete of
everything — the one mistake this command must not be able to make by omission.

**A delete that matched nothing is an answer.** It exits 0 and says it removed
nothing, because "there was nothing to remove" is a fact about the store rather
than a failure of the command, and a script that treated it as an error would
stop on the ordinary case. An id that is not in the store is different:
`sure history show` on one cannot answer what was asked, so it exits 5 and says
which store it looked in.

**Nothing is removed because a date passed.** Every session carries a
`kept until` date and this build has no job that acts on one; the listing says
so in the same breath as the date, because a date printed alone reads as a
retention policy that is being enforced. Deleting is something a user does.

What a delete reaches is every table the session touched — `sessions`,
`session_events`, the `records` those events own, and any full recording written
for one of them — in one transaction. The counts are reported apart because
"the transcript is gone too" is a different claim from "the session row is
gone", and a single total would answer neither.

`sure history` is also the first command here whose answer is **not about a
project**, which is why it does not go through `Store::open`: there is no
project to keep it out of, and a history that read one project's records would
be answering a question nobody asked.

## `sure protocol`

Asked with nothing, it prints the version of the harness protocol this build
speaks — the same number every response frame carries as `protocol_version`.

Asked with `--speaks VERSION`, it answers whether this build can talk to a
caller that speaks `VERSION`. This is the handshake an adapter runs before it
sends anything, and the reason it is a command rather than a sentence in each
adapter's own language: the rule about which versions can talk lives in
`crates/sure-protocol/src/handshake.rs`, in one function that the event reader
also uses to refuse a document. An adapter reading the answer cannot be told
"yes" by the CLI and then refused at the first event, which is a failure that
would look like a broken adapter and send somebody looking in the wrong place.

The rule is **exact equality**. A protocol version changes exactly when an older
reader would get the format *wrong*, so a version mismatch means a document that
would be misread — and a misread event becomes wrong evidence about a project.
There is no range of "still close enough".

The two directions are not the same answer, and the message says which one it
is, because a caller that has just been refused will otherwise try the fix that
cannot work:

| Caller speaks | Status | What the caller has to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| this build's version | 0 | nothing; both sides speak it |
| an older version | 3 | update itself — a newer SURE will not accept it either |
| a newer version | 3 | update SURE |

Status **3**, not 4. A version SURE will not speak is a command this build
cannot carry out, which is what 3 means everywhere else on this surface, and in
the newer-caller direction the remedy is literally a newer build. 4 is reserved
for a refusal grounded in the user's configuration — what SURE's own settings
say it is allowed to do — and no setting makes this build speak a protocol it
was not compiled with.

The machine form carries the numbers and which side moves, and not the sentence:
a script that read prose would break the first time the prose was improved.

```json
{"command":"protocol","details":{"agreed":false,"caller_speaks":2,"sure_speaks":1,"update":"sure"},"exit_code":3,"outcome":"unavailable","protocol_version":1,"sure_version":"0.0.0-bootstrap"}
```

## `sure mcp serve`

The one command that runs for as long as its caller wants it to rather than until
it has an answer, and a surface on the other commands rather than a command of
its own. A coding harness launches the process, speaks the Model Context Protocol
on its standard input and output, and closes the stream when it is done. SURE
never listens on anything: there is no socket and no port, and the caller is the
process that started this one.

It answers a handshake, `ping`, `tools/list` and `tools/call`, and it exposes five
tools: `sure_check`, `sure_get_report`, `sure_get_repair`, `sure_recheck` and
`sure_status`. Each tool builds the command line in the table above and asks
`Command::report` — the same dispatch every other command goes through — so a
tool cannot check, repair or report anything by a path of its own, and cannot
answer in words the command line would not use. A tool whose command this build
cannot carry out is a *tool error carrying that command's own refusal*, not a
refusal of `sure mcp`: the caller asked for a check, and telling it the bridge is
missing would name the wrong thing.

A tool call may name a project and nothing else. Execution mode, privacy settings
and protection policy come from the user's own SURE configuration on the user's
own machine, and **no argument can select or override them**; a call that tries
is refused with a protocol error that says so. A project path is passed to the
command unchanged, so a relative or unreadable path is refused exactly as the
command line refuses it.

`stdout` carries protocol messages and nothing else, in **every** mode,
`--format json` included. The session summary is one CLI envelope, and the
session's stream is not the place for it: Model Context Protocol revision
`2025-11-25` says "The server **MUST NOT** write anything to its `stdout` that is
not a valid MCP message", and an envelope is not a message. So a session summary
goes to `stderr` whichever format was asked for — the one report in this
document that does not follow the rule below — and a caller that reads this
command's `stdout` as a protocol stream may pass `--format json` like any other
caller. Until P12-T010 the flag put one unparseable line after the last message,
which is what the fix removed; `Format::emit` in `crates/sure-cli/src/output.rs`
is the whole of the exception, and
`crates/sure-cli/tests/mcp_protocol.rs::no_line_that_is_not_a_protocol_message_reaches_stdout_in_any_mode`
reads three command lines back from the process to check it.

The process returns 0 when the session ends normally and 5 when the stream it was
talking on could not be read or written. The statuses of the commands behind the
tools do not travel in the process's status: each tool result carries its
command's own frame, `exit_code` included. `docs/architecture/MCP_BRIDGE.md` is
the contract for the protocol side.

## `sure check --goal TEXT`

The first place on this surface where a command changes something the output does
not contain: the goal goes into the user's record store. Everything below follows
from having to be honest about that.

**What a run with `--goal` does.** It writes the text, verbatim, as a project
intent whose `source` is `explicit_user_goal` — the source the domain marks as a
user requirement, and the one that asks for no transcript recording. There is no
session to capture: the words arrived with the command that stored them.
`docs/architecture/PROJECT_INTENT.md` is the contract; this section is the
command-line half of it.

**Then the check runs against it.** The recorded goal is stage 2's input: the run
resolves its intent partly from what the user stated, and the verdict says what
that intent was worth (`must_caveat_requirements`) as it does for a run with no
goal at all. Reporting a receipt and no check would be the worse of the two
answers — the user asked for a check.

**The report says what was recorded.** `details.recorded_goal` carries the goal,
its requirement identifier, the source as the domain's wire name, and the project
state it was recorded against — the kind and the digest, which is what two runs
can compare, plus the identifier of the reading itself. The prose prints the same
facts in words. A run with no `--goal` answers with `null` there rather than a
placeholder: an empty goal object would be a stored goal no user ever stated, and
`null` is what this frame says wherever something did not happen — `reason` and
`stopped_at` in the stage records are the same spelling.

**The status is the run's own.** A run that recorded a goal and checked the
project returns 0 for a clean project, 1 for a project that was checked and is
not clean, and 5 for a run that tried and did not finish — the same three
statuses every other check returns. It is **not** 3. 3 is "this build cannot
carry that out", whose remedy is a newer build, and this build just carried it
out.

**The goal is bound to a project state.** The store's only project-aware write
takes a fingerprint, and the binding is right: a goal recorded with no project is
a row no reader looking for *this project's* goal can find. The report names the
kind and the digest of the state it recorded against.

**The project is read before the store is opened.** Opening a store creates its
directory and its file. Every refusal in this path therefore leaves the machine
as it found it, which is a promise a user can check and a failure report can
stand on. A run with no `--goal` does not create a store either: it opens the
history only when there is one already, so a check on a machine that has never
used SURE writes nothing at all.

**A run that could not finish is 5, not 3.** 3 is "this build cannot carry that
out", whose remedy is a newer build. A run that met an unreadable project or a
store it could not open tried and did not finish, which is what 5 is for. One
status for both is how a broken installation gets read as a build that has
nothing to do. The one failure in this path that *did* write something says so in
its own words rather than reusing the sentence for the refusals.

An empty goal — `--goal ""`, or one holding nothing but whitespace — is a
failure, not a usage error. It is a goal with no words in it, which is a thing a
user can type, so the parser accepts it and the check refuses it.

### What this flag does not do

SURE cannot authenticate its own command line. `--goal "…"` records that
*somebody who could run this binary* stated that goal; it cannot establish that
the words are what a person asked for rather than what a script decided to
record. That is why the source is `explicit_user_goal` and remains a claim about
provenance rather than a proof of it, and why a goal is never turned into a
finding by being stored. `docs/architecture/PROJECT_INTENT.md` states the limit
in full.

## `--store-dir DIR`

Where this run's record store goes, as a directory: `sure.db` is written inside
it. It is global, so it is accepted before or after the command name, and it is
the only thing on this surface that changes where SURE writes something.

**Which commands write there, and which does not.** `--store-dir` says *where*;
this says *whether*. `sure check` reports and remembers nothing: it opens a store
only when one is already there and creates nothing, before or after, so a check
on a machine that has never used SURE writes no file at all. `sure repair` and
`sure recheck` carry the repair loop, and a loop with no memory is not a loop, so
those two create the store when it is missing and record every finding the run
leaves open. That is what lets a second run say what the first left open, and it
is why the same project gives a different answer to `sure recheck` on its second
run than on its first. A run that checked the project and then could not record
what it left open returns status 5 and says exactly that, rather than reporting a
clean-looking run whose evidence was thrown away.

**The value comes from the process's argument vector and from nowhere else**, and
that is the whole of the design rather than a detail of it. It is not read from
`.sure/config`, from a manifest field, or from a file beside the sources: the
project being checked may be edited by the agent whose work SURE is evaluating,
so a location its own file could name is a location it could point at a directory
it can write to — and the history a verdict is read from would then be the
history the judged thing writes. There is deliberately **no environment
variable** either, for the same reason one step out: a checked project's harness
configuration can set the environment of the processes it starts, so
`SURE_STORE_DIR` would be settable from inside the checked project.
`docs/architecture/STORAGE_AND_DATA_PATHS.md` carries the full reasoning, and two
tests in `crates/sure-cli/tests/cli_contract.rs` hold it to it rather than
stating it: `nothing_a_project_can_write_decides_where_the_store_goes` reads the
modules that decide the location and fails if one of them reads the environment,
and `every_command_is_reached_by_the_location_the_caller_named` reads every
crate's shipped code and fails if a command calls the no-argument
`Paths::discover()` — the shape a command that ignored its caller would take.

**The default is unchanged, and it is not a fallback chain.** A caller who names
nothing gets the platform's own per-user location through `sure_core::paths`,
exactly as before this flag existed. Nothing tries the platform location first
and falls back to a named one, or the reverse: a location that cannot be used is
an error rather than a quiet write somewhere else.

**What a wrong location does.** A path that is relative — including the empty
string — is refused by the parser, status 2, because a relative path resolves
against whatever directory SURE happened to be started in and whether it was
inside the project would then depend on that. A location the run cannot write to
is status 5: it tried and did not finish, which is the same status every other
unusable store gets. A location that does not exist yet is not an error:
`doctor` reports it as not created yet, the first write creates it, and `doctor`
still does not create it.

**A location inside the project being checked is refused**, by the same
`Paths::ensure_outside` rule the `--goal` path already used, and in the same
shape: status 5, a message that says what it did and did not do, and no store
directory created. The check refuses before it opens the store, so the refusal
leaves the machine as it found it.

`sure doctor` says which of the two locations a run is using, so a caller who is
not sure whether their redirect took effect can ask instead of guessing.

## Two output paths, and no third

| `--format` | Stream | Shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `human` (default) | stdout for an answer, stderr for a complaint | prose for a person |
| `json` | stdout, except for the one report row three names | one object on one line |
| `human` or `json`, `sure mcp serve` | stderr | the session summary, which is not a result |

`--format` is global, so it is accepted before or after the command name.

The rule that matters is not that there are two renderers. It is that there is
no third way out: `crates/sure-cli/src/output.rs` is the only module in the
crate that names a process stream, and
`crates/sure-cli/tests/cli_contract.rs::only_the_output_module_writes_to_a_stream`
reads the sources and fails if another one appears. That is a source scan
rather than a test of behaviour because what is being ruled out is an
*absence* — a stray `println!` is invisible until the day somebody pipes the
output into a JSON reader, and by then it is in a release.

A command's answer is prose on stdout, which is what makes `sure check >
report.txt` put the report in the file. A complaint goes to stderr, so the same
redirection leaves it where the person can see it. The machine form always goes
to stdout, including when the command failed: the object *is* the result, and a
script that asked for the reason has to be able to read it.

The third row is the one exception, and it is not a judgement about output. A
session summary is not a result of this program being asked something; it is a
diagnostic about a conversation SURE is having with a harness on the very stream
the other two rows would use, and the caller on that stream is parsing messages.
So it goes to stderr in both formats, and nothing else about the two paths
changes: `Report::McpSession` is the only report that takes it, and `Format::emit`
is the only place that decides.

### The frame

A complaint:

```json
{"command":"history","does":"…","exit_code":3,"instead":"…","outcome":"unavailable","protocol_version":1,"sure_version":"0.0.0-bootstrap"}
```

A report:

```json
{"command":"doctor","details":{"build":{…},"not_checked":[…],"places":{…},"problems":[…],"store":{…},"tools":[…]}},"exit_code":0,"outcome":"ok","protocol_version":1,"sure_version":"0.0.0-bootstrap"}
```

A run that did not finish is a complaint too, and keeps the envelope:

```json
{"command":"check","details":{"detail":"…","what":"Nothing was recorded, and nothing was checked."},"exit_code":5,"outcome":"failed","protocol_version":1,"sure_version":"0.0.0-bootstrap"}
```

A check that finished puts the whole run under `details`, including one entry per
stage in the order `CHECK_PIPELINE.md` lists them, each with its outcome
(`ran`, `not_run`, `not_part_of_work`, `unfinished`) and, when it did not run,
the vocabulary's own reason plus the sentence a person reads:

```json
{"command":"check","details":{"checked_count":0,"green":false,"has_critical_gaps":true,"mode":"inspect_only","not_checked_count":18,"project":"…","purpose":"check","recorded_goal":null,"report":{…},"stages":[{"detail":"…","number":1,"outcome":"ran","reason":null,"stage":"discover","title":"Find the project's parts"},…,{"detail":"…","number":6,"outcome":"not_run","reason":"execution_not_authorized","reason_explained":"Checking this would have meant running your project's code, and you have not allowed that.","stage":"dynamic-checks","title":"Run the project's own checks"},…],"state":"finished","stopped_at":null,"support":{"letter":"C","level":"inspect_only","reason":"…"}},"exit_code":1,"outcome":"not_green","protocol_version":1,"sure_version":"0.0.0-bootstrap"}
```

Five fields are always present: `sure_version` and `protocol_version`, so that a
captured response says which build and which protocol produced it — those are
the two things that make a stored answer unreadable, and a response that names
neither invites the reader to assume the current ones — `command` and `outcome`,
which are what a reader switches on, and `exit_code`, which is the status the
process returned. The last was first written only for a complaint, on the idea
that a field should appear when it says something; that is the wrong test for
this one, because a frame where it is sometimes absent is a frame a script has
to special-case. The status is a fact about every run.

`outcome` is a closed set: `ok`, `not_green`, `unavailable`, `failed`. It grows
when a command can end another way, and every reader's switch has to grow with
it. `failed` arrived with `sure check --goal` (P2-T010), the first command that
can try and not finish, and a check that stops at a stage it cannot get past —
an unreadable project, a history it cannot read — ends the same way.

`outcome` and `exit_code` are one decision written twice: `Report::outcome` and
`Report::exit_code` read the same predicate, so a build where they disagree is
not a build that can happen. They are both here because they are read by
different things — `outcome` is what a person's script switches on in the body,
and the status is what a caller acts on without parsing anything.

`not_green` says the answer is not a clean one — `sure doctor` on a machine
where SURE found something wrong with its own files, or `sure check` on a project
that was checked and is not clean. That is still an *answer*: it goes to stdout,
so `sure doctor > report.txt` puts the report in the file and the exit status
carries the bad news on its own. A complaint is SURE saying it could not do the
thing at all, and that goes to stderr.

Anything a command found goes under `details`, one key, written by that command's
own module. The five fields above then keep meaning exactly what this section
says they mean, whatever a command has to report. `sure protocol --speaks` is
the case that shows why: it answers with a complaint — `unavailable`, status 3 —
and still has three facts to hand over, so they go under `details` rather than
becoming three more top-level fields that only one command ever writes.

**This frame is not one of the seven documents in
`docs/architecture/PROTOCOL.md`.** Those are statements about a project or an
event, each with a JSON Schema in `schemas/`; this is the envelope a command
answers in. `docs/architecture/PROTOCOL.md` carries the same note, because a
sentence there says that everything SURE writes is one of the seven, and a CLI
response is written.

The frame lives in `sure-cli` rather than in `sure-protocol` because it has one
consumer. `sure-protocol` holds contracts with things outside this repository,
and generalising a shape before a second caller needs it is how a contract
becomes a guess — which is the reasoning ADR 0012 used to turn down a logging
framework. When P12-T009's MCP server needs the same envelope, it moves, with a
real second consumer in hand.

P12-T009 arrived and the move did not happen, which is a decision rather than an
omission. The bridge did not need a second envelope: it lives in this crate, it
builds `Report::Mcp` values, and a protocol message *is* that report's machine
form — the same `Report::frame` writes both. The tool results embed the
command's frame verbatim under `structuredContent.sure`, which is that same call
rather than a second renderer agreeing with the first. The trigger for the move is
a consumer outside this crate needing the shape; a bridge inside it is not one.

### What a run says about privacy and models

A check report carries one more section in each rendering, and it exists because
neither answer is derivable by a user from anything else SURE prints: which
privacy mode the run was under, and whether a model was consulted.

```
Privacy and model use

  Mode in effect: local_first
    Nothing set this: it is what SURE does when no settings file asks for something stricter.
    Evidence stays on this machine. External analysis is allowed only where your own settings configure it, and nothing is sent by a check that does not ask for it.
  Analysis provider: disabled
  No model was consulted: no analysis provider is configured (`analysis.provider` is `disabled`). The deterministic checks are unaffected.
```

The machine form carries `details.privacy` (`mode`, `mode_set_by`,
`project_mode`, `external_analysis_allowed`, `analysis_provider`) and
`details.model_use` (`state`, `provider`). `model_use.state` is a closed set —
`no_provider`, `nothing_asked`, `provider_unusable`, `consulted`,
`cannot_confirm` — and it is deliberately not a boolean: `false` would have to
stand for both "a model was not consulted" and "this run cannot say", and a
script reading the reassuring half of an ambiguous field is how "nothing was
sent" gets asserted about a run that never reached the stage.

Three rules, each of which a test holds:

- **The mode is the arbitrated one.** It is `Authority::privacy_mode()`'s value,
  not the project's `privacy.mode`, and `mode_set_by` names the layer that
  decided. A run that reported the project's request as the user's policy would
  be making a false statement about the user's own settings — see
  `docs/architecture/CONFIG_AUTHORITY.md`.
- **The no-model case is stated, never omitted.** Silence reads both as "nothing
  left this machine" and as "SURE did not look", and only one of those is true.
- **A stopped run is not a run that sent nothing.** It has settings, so it
  answers; and because it has no record of the stage that would ask a model, it
  says it cannot confirm rather than that nothing was used.

`docs/architecture/PRIVACY_AND_MODEL_STRATEGY.md` is the semantics behind all of
this, and the honest limit of this release: no check in this build asks for
model-backed analysis, so external model use cannot be observed happening, and
`consulted` is unreachable. What the run states is a fact about its
configuration and its own record, not a report of traffic.

## Exit statuses

| Status | Meaning | Who returns it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | the command did what it says it does | `version`, `protocol`, `doctor` when it found nothing wrong, `history` — including a listing with nothing in it and a delete whose scope matched nothing — `--help`, `--version`; `hook ingest` when the action it answered with is allow or warn, so a launcher is not stopped; `hook allow-once` when the grant was written |
| 1 | the command ran, and the answer is not a clean one | `doctor` when it found something wrong; `check`, `recheck` and `repair` when the project was checked and is not clean; `hook ingest` when the action it answered with is a block, which is the answer a launcher relays |
| 2 | the command line was wrong | the parser, including a bare `sure` |
| 3 | the command exists, and this build cannot carry it out | everything in the table above marked "not implemented"; `sure protocol --speaks` for a version this build does not speak |
| 4 | SURE declined, and can say why in the user's terms | reserved; configuration authority and path rules |
| 5 | the command tried and did not finish | `check`, `recheck` and `repair` when the project, the store or the goal could not be read or written; `mcp serve` when its stream could not be read or written; `history show` for an id that is not in the store, and any history command when the store is there and cannot be read; `hook allow-once` when it declines to write the grant — a window it does not record, or a project and tool whose settings leave no request naming that tool an allowance could be spent on; anything, including a result that could not be written out |

**A check reaches 0 only through the pipeline's own answer**, and in this build
no run does: a project SURE can plan for has stage 5 recorded as `unknown`
(there is no runner for a planned check yet) and stage 8 recorded as
`analysis_provider_disabled` (no model provider is configured), and a project
with no parts at all still has stage 8 unconfigured. A stage that did not run is
recorded as such, and a run with one of those is never reported as clean — which
is what the false-green rule asks for, and it means `sure check` returns 1 for
every project it can read and 5 for one it cannot. `sure repair` and `sure
recheck` return the same statuses for the same reasons. Stages 11 and 12 do
their work now, on a project that has findings, and that changes no status
either: a repair contract checks nothing — it says what would have to pass — so
a command that wrote one and reached 0 would be the false green this table
exists to prevent. Nothing in this file has to change the day a runner lands:
the status comes from the verdict, and the verdict is what will change.

The whole table is in `crates/sure-cli/src/report.rs` as `report::exit`, and it
is the only place a status is chosen. `main` handles clap's parse error itself
rather than letting `clap::Parser::parse` exit the process, because a table
where one row is a library's decision is a table that quietly becomes wrong.

Two statuses are reserved before anything returns them. A script written against
this release should not have to be rewritten because a later one reused a number
for something else.

**1 and 3 are not the same and must not be merged.** "The project has problems"
and "SURE cannot do that here" need opposite responses from the person reading
them, and one status for both is how a tool that is broken gets read as a
project that is clean.

One code for two meanings is right where a caller does the same thing with both.
`sure check` finding problems and `sure doctor` finding a damaged store are both
"stop and read the report": the report says which, and the status is what stops
the script.

### A bare `sure` is not a success

It did nothing, so status 0 would let a script that invoked the wrong thing read
it as a clean run. It is status 2, the same as any other wrong command line.

## Why clap

`docs/architecture/RUST_DESIGN.md` names it, and it earns its place on a surface
this user-visible: usage errors that name the flag, `--help` that cannot drift
from the grammar the parser actually accepts, and the `--` handling that decides
whether a path beginning with a dash is a flag or a path. Hand-rolling that is
where "an unknown flag was accepted and ignored" comes from, which is this
program's version of a false green.

What clap decides is what the command line means. What it does not decide is
anything about output or status: both are SURE's, and both have one home.

The last row has no test, because it does not need one: `Command::report` and
`Command::name` both match every variant with no fallback arm, so adding a
command to the grammar stops the build until somebody decides. That was checked
by adding one and watching the build fail in both places, not argued.

### The gap that was here, and how it closed

Until P1-T012 this section recorded a gap rather than a test. `cli_contract.rs`
runs the binary as a process, and it deliberately never ran `sure check --goal`
with a goal that had words in it: such a run writes to the store **the
developer's own machine really uses** — on Windows the data directory comes from
`SHGetKnownFolderPath`, which ignores `LOCALAPPDATA`, so no environment variable
could point it at a scratch directory. A test that did it would put an invented
requirement into somebody's history and look exactly like a green test.

**That was not hypothetical, and the instance is worth keeping.** During
`P2-T010`'s mutation run the mutation that deletes the empty-goal refusal — the
first mutation in `target/tmp/mutate12.py` — made exactly that happen: the
process-level test ran the real binary, the refusal was gone, and six empty-text
`project-intent` rows were written to the developer's store. The unmutated suite
was then measured around a single run and left that store byte-identical, so it
was a coverage gap rather than active pollution. But the margin was a refusal in
the module under test, not a boundary around the store, and the whole of the
flag's process-level coverage was the refusal rather than the write.

`--store-dir` is what closes it, and it closes both halves:

- **The write is covered by a process test.**
  `cli_contract.rs::a_named_store_directory_is_the_one_a_real_run_writes_to` runs
  a real `sure check --goal` with words in it against a store the test names, and
  asserts the file appeared *there* and that the store the machine really uses is
  byte-identical afterwards. The happy path is no longer only reachable by
  `crates/sure-cli/src/check.rs`'s in-process tests.
- **The store the machine uses is now fenced off rather than relied upon.**
  Every run in `cli_contract.rs` and `mcp_protocol.rs` that could write names a
  store under `target/tmp/`, and the two tests that specifically must not name one
  — the bare `sure doctor` in
  `a_doctor_report_says_which_store_location_the_run_is_using` and the hook
  ingest — assert the machine's store is unchanged around them.
  `hook_ingest_reads_standard_input_and_evaluates_protection` is the one that
  used to write: it drove a real `sure hook ingest`, and that process opened and
  wrote `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SURE\sure.db` (measured: 4096 bytes added by one isolated
  run).

**What that test can and cannot see.** `assert_untouched` in `cli_contract.rs`
compares the store file's bytes before and after the runs it makes, and its
failure message names the outside writers it cannot rule out — another test
binary, a `sure` process somebody started, or a harness hook. It cannot see a
write from a test binary that has not run yet; it sees the runs made in this
file, in the order this file makes them. What covers the rest is the full
`cargo test --workspace`, watched from outside with the file hashed immediately
before and after, which is a measurement rather than a test and is recorded in
`progress/` by whoever runs it rather than asserted here.

## What this document does not cover

- **What a check finds, and the twelve stages that find it.**
  `docs/architecture/CHECK_PIPELINE.md` is the list of stages, and
  `crates/sure-cli/src/json_report.rs` is the versioned report shape a script
  reads (`schema_version` 3). What a stage means is that stage's own module.
- **What a goal becomes once it is stored, and what may be read out of it.**
  `docs/architecture/PROJECT_INTENT.md`. That document owns the trust labels and
  the rule that an unauthenticated statement is never a finding; this one owns
  the flag that carries it.
- **What a hook receives.** `docs/architecture/EVENT_PROTOCOL.md` and
  `docs/integrations/`.
- **Who has to run the handshake.** The rule is here and
  `docs/architecture/PROTOCOL.md` states it; the hook and the MCP adapter are
  commands SURE does not implement yet, so nothing but a caller's own shell has
  used it. They arrive with the phases that build them, and they have to use the
  same function rather than their own comparison.
- **How `sure doctor` decides what a problem is.** That is
  `crates/sure-core/src/doctor.rs`, which says what each state means and why a
  fresh installation is not one of them.
- **Interactive prompting.** Nothing prompts yet. `sure history delete` needs no
  prompt: it is non-interactive by construction, and the scope on the command
  line is the consent — see its section above. A command that deletes things has
  to answer a script, and a prompt is the one answer a script cannot give.
