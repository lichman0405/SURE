# Frozen semantics

This document is the authoritative index of what SURE's words mean, and where
each meaning is enforced in code. It is written for implementers. User-facing
language rules live in `docs/product/UX_AND_LANGUAGE.md`.

The rule this document exists to support: **the meaning of a stored verdict,
finding or evidence record must not change by accident.** When a meaning changes
on purpose, bump `sure_domain::DOMAIN_SEMANTICS_VERSION` and record why.

## Related decisions

## Statuses

Six statuses, no others:

| Status | Means | Produced a result about the project? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pass` | It ran and the project satisfied it. | yes |
| `fail` | It ran and the project did not satisfy it. | yes |
| `warning` | It ran and the project partially satisfied it. | yes |
| `skipped` | It was deliberately not run. | **no** |
| `error` | It was attempted and the checker failed. | **no** |
| `unknown` | SURE has no basis for a verdict. | **no** |

`skipped`, `error` and `unknown` all mean the project was not checked. They are
never a pass and never disappear from the report.

## Aggregation rules

When results are aggregated:

1. A **critical** check that `fail`ed makes the run `not_ready`.
2. A **critical** check that `error`ed, is `unknown`, or was `skipped` for any
   reason other than an honest scope limit makes the run `not_enough_checked`.
   A denied execution consent lands here: it is not a pass.
3. A run where nothing produced a result is `not_enough_checked`. This includes
   an empty plan.
4. Otherwise, any `fail`, `warning`, `error`, `unknown`, `skipped`, or a
   critical check that was out of scope makes the run `needs_attention`.
5. Only when every recorded check passed and at least one ran is the run
   `green`.

A critical check is **out of scope** when its reason is `not_applicable`,
`unsupported_stack` or `disabled_by_configuration`. Those reasons are honest
scope limits the user chose or the project shape implies. Every other
not-checked reason is a gap and counts against a green verdict.

Independently of the aggregate, `ProjectVerdict::is_ready_for_hand_off` returns
false whenever an open `must_fix` finding exists. A green aggregate next to an
open `must_fix` finding is a contradiction that must never be presented as ready.

## Severity

Four levels, in the exact wording used with users:

| Level | Wire name | Label | Blocks hand-off alone |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `MustFix` | `must_fix` | Must fix | yes |
| `ShouldFixFirst` | `should_fix_first` | Should fix first | no |
| `CanFixLater` | `can_fix_later` | Can fix later | no |
| `Note` | `note` | Note | no |

Ordering is written by hand so that "greater" always means "more serious".
There is no numeric confidence score: uncertainty is `cannot_confirm`.

## Evidence

Five classes, strongest first. `truth_rank` numbers the order.

| Class | Wire name | Rank | Can alone support a `must_fix` finding |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ObservedFact` | `observed_fact` | 0 | yes |
| `DeterministicCheck` | `deterministic_check` | 1 | yes |
| `ModelAssessment` | `model_assessment` | 2 | **no** |
| `Inference` | `inference` | 3 | **no** |
| `Unknown` | `unknown` | 4 | **no** |

An anchor is checkable only when it has both a location and a locator. Evidence
carries the fingerprint it applies to; evidence whose fingerprint differs from
the current one is stale, and evidence with no fingerprint is never fresh.

Claim assessments: `confirmed`, `contradicted`, `cannot_confirm`,
`not_checkable`. `cannot_confirm` is not `contradicted` and never renders as one.

## Intent trust

| Source | Wire name | Rank | Is a user requirement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Explicit user goal | `explicit_user_goal` | 0 | yes |
| Observed user request | `observed_user_request` | 1 | yes |
| Project specification | `project_spec` | 2 | no — documentation |
| Agent claim | `agent_claim` | 3 | no — a claim, not proof |
| Inference | `inferred` | 4 | **never** |

Without a user-requirement source, every report must state
`NO_TRUSTED_INTENT_LIMITATION`, verbatim:

> I can check whether the current project runs and whether anything obviously
> looks incomplete. I cannot confirm that it matches your original request
> because that request was not provided to SURE.

`may_claim_full_fulfilment` is the only gate for the sentence "everything you
asked for is done". It requires a trusted source *and* fresh supporting evidence
for every user requirement.

## Execution trust

Three modes: `inspect_only`, `host_confirmed`, `container`.

Six **independent** permissions: `inspect`, `run_project_code`,
`install_dependencies`, `network`, `write_project`, `connect_service`. Granting
one never grants another. `inspect_only` grants only `inspect`.
`host_confirmed` grants `inspect` and `run_project_code`, and nothing more.

An `ArbitraryCommand` always resolves to `needs_consent`, in every mode,
because SURE cannot classify it. Consent carries the exact argument vector and
the working directory; execution never round-trips through a shell string.

A consent grantor can be the interactive user, user-level configuration, or
organization policy. A project-controlled file can **request** authority and is
recorded as `ProjectRequestEscalated`, which `can_grant()` rejects.

## Capability tiers

| Tier | Number | Wire name | Means |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Snapshot` | 0 | `snapshot` | The project as it is now. Nothing about the session. |
| `Observed` | 1 | `observed` | What the agent did, after the fact. |
| `Protected` | 2 | `protected` | SURE can decide before an action happens. |

`CapabilityReport::is_self_consistent` requires `pre_action_control` to be true
exactly at the protected tier. A contradictory report is a bug, not a weaker
claim. Blind spots are enumerated so a missing observation is reported as a gap.

## Identity format

Every entity ID is `<prefix>_<body>`, where body is lowercase
`[a-z0-9]` and non-empty:

| Kind | Prefix |
| --- | --- |
| Project | `prj` |
| Fingerprint | `fp` |
| Session | `ses` |
| Event | `evt` |
| Run | `run` |
| Check | `chk` |
| Finding | `fnd` |
| Repair | `rep` |
| Claim | `clm` |
| Evidence | `evd` |

The narrow alphabet is a deliberate choice: an ID is safe in a file name, a URL
fragment and a terminal report without escaping. Generated IDs use a counter
plus a per-process seed and are not cryptographic. They are local identifiers,
never security tokens.

A run is not a session. A run is one execution of SURE; a session is observed
harness activity, and either can exist without the other. `run` was added in
P1-T006 and `DOMAIN_SEMANTICS_VERSION` was not bumped: no stored verdict,
finding or evidence record is reinterpreted by a new kind existing, and
`docs/adr/0010-frozen-domain-semantics-in-code.md` requires a bump for a change
of meaning, not for an addition.

## What "the same project state" means

A fingerprint answers one question — *is the evidence I have still about the
project in front of me?* — and the answer is a `bool` that a stored verdict
inherits. So what counts as "the same state" is not an implementation detail: it
decides whether a green is still a green. The full rule is
`docs/architecture/FINGERPRINTING.md`; what is frozen here is the vocabulary and
the three semantic choices that no later task may quietly reverse.

**`matches` compares `kind` and `digest`, never `id`.** The `id` is fresh on
every computation, because two fingerprints have to be distinguishable by value
when they differ; the `digest` is what two states share when they are the same
state. Comparing `id` would answer "no" always, which is safe and useless;
comparing `digest` alone would let a `Content` digest and a `Git` digest be
compared as though they were the same kind of claim about a project.

**There is no partial fingerprint, and no "unknown" one.** `FingerprintKind` has
two variants and neither means "I could not tell". A fingerprint that cannot be
computed is an `Err` (`crates/sure-core/src/fingerprint/error.rs`), never a value
with an empty or truncated digest — a wrong answer wearing the shape of a right
one is exactly the false green this product exists to prevent. The same rule
reaches the limits: exceeding `max_files` or `max_bytes` is `TooManyFiles` or
`TooManyBytes`, not a digest over the part that fitted.

**The digest is a claim with a version, not a number.** Each kind's digest is
opened by a domain tag — currently `sure.git-fingerprint.v1` — and the tag is
part of what the value means. A change to **what goes into** a digest is a change
of meaning and takes a new tag; it is never made silently, because stored
fingerprints outlive the build that wrote them and a digest has no way to say
which rule produced it. Adding a field that is not digested, or recording one
that is not compared, is not such a change.

Three consequences that a reader may expect to go the other way, and do not:

| Choice | The reader's expectation | Why it is the other way |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The branch name is recorded but not digested | a rename is a change to the project | no file moved; a fingerprint that moved would teach a person to ignore the word *stale*, which is how the dangerous direction gets missed |
| HEAD is digested | a checkout of a different commit with the same tree is the same content | it is the same **content** and a different **state** — evidence was produced against one commit, and SURE cannot know what a later check will read |
| A tracked file under `target/` is not covered | it is in the repository, so it is part of the project | no check reads it, so changing it cannot change any answer; covering it would mark every result stale when a committed artefact was rebuilt |

The third is the one place the fingerprint is narrower than "everything Git
tracks", and the narrowing is published rather than silent: a file is covered if
and only if a check could read it.

`crates/sure-domain/src/vocabulary.rs` holds `FingerprintKind`, `GitState` and
`ProjectFingerprint`; their wire names are in the tables above and are held still
by `crates/sure-domain/tests/wire_contract.rs` in the same way as every other
enum.

Enforced by: `crates/sure-domain/src/vocabulary.rs` (`matches`, both variants
named), `crates/sure-domain/tests/wire_contract.rs` (no wildcard arm),
`crates/sure-core/tests/fingerprint_git.rs`
(`renaming_the_branch_is_not_a_change_to_the_project`,
`two_different_commits_of_one_tree_are_two_fingerprints`,
`a_tracked_file_in_a_build_directory_is_not_in_the_fingerprint`,
`a_project_with_more_changes_than_the_limit_has_no_fingerprint`,
`a_project_with_more_content_than_the_limit_has_no_fingerprint`),
`crates/sure-core/src/fingerprint/digest.rs`
(`a_digest_of_one_kind_is_never_a_digest_of_another`).

## How the wire names are held still

The tables above are the contract. `crates/sure-domain/tests/wire_contract.rs`
is what makes breaking it visible, in three ways:

1. Every enum's `ALL` is declared by `variants!` in the module that defines the
   enum, so nothing that needs to visit the whole vocabulary can quietly skip a
   variant.
2. The test spells every wire name out as a literal and matches on each enum
   with **no wildcard arm**. Adding a variant stops the test crate from
   compiling until someone decides what the new variant is called on the wire.
3. For the six enums that also appear in a JSON schema, the test reads the
   schema's `enum` array and compares it to the Rust list, so the two statements
   of the contract cannot drift apart.

Order is deliberately not asserted: serde is name-based, and reordering variants
is not a wire change.

## Closed vocabularies are matched in full

A question about a closed enum — *how strong is this evidence? is this skip a
loss? which layer may grant this?* — is answered by a `match` with **one arm per
variant and no wildcard**, never by a `bool` predicate that happens to hold and
never by the negation of a neighbouring predicate.

Two reasons, and the second is the one that bites:

1. Adding a variant stops every such `match` from compiling until someone decides
   the answer for the new variant. That is the whole mechanism, and it only works
   if there is no `_ =>` arm to absorb it.
2. A negation answers for the variant nobody thought about. It answers `false` —
   *not a loss*, *not a requirement*, *nothing to grant* — and the quiet answer is
   the one that turns an unchecked thing into a green one.

The same rule applies to **naming**: do not offer a name for something the code
cannot produce. `ConsentGrantor` deliberately cannot name organization policy,
because a source a caller can name but never obtain is how a documented feature
becomes a believed one (`docs/architecture/CONFIG_AUTHORITY.md`), and
`SkipReason` deliberately cannot name "outside the project", because a reason a
caller can handle is a reason a caller believes can occur
(`docs/architecture/PROJECT_DISCOVERY.md`). A variant that becomes reachable
arrives with a test that reaches it, in the same change.

Enforced by: `crates/sure-domain/tests/wire_contract.rs` (no wildcard arm),
`crates/sure-core/src/scan/skip.rs` (both predicates, in full),
`crates/sure-core/src/config/authority.rs` (no rank 3).

## Known conformance gaps

These are recorded so they are not forgotten. They are resolved by the tasks
named, not by this document.

1. ~~**Event envelope drift.**~~ **Resolved by P1-T007.**
   `schemas/event.schema.json` now defines `capability_tier` and `project_root`,
   and closes the envelope with `additionalProperties: false` so that an adapter
   field SURE does not understand is a visible error rather than silence.
   `docs/architecture/PROTOCOL.md` records the reasoning.
2. **Fixture metadata vs expectation schema.** The fourteen
   `fixtures/adversarial/*/scenario.json` files carry
   `expected_severity`/`description`/`fixture_status`, while
   `schemas/fixture-expectation.schema.json` requires `required_outcomes`.
   `evaluation/acceptance-manifest.json` lists twenty cases, which is the
   authority for the release corpus. Resolved by P14-T001–T011.
3. **The six stored documents have no version.** Unlike the event envelope, a
   finding or a check result cannot say which build wrote it, so a field from a
   newer SURE is dropped silently on read. Recorded by a test in
   `crates/sure-protocol/tests/round_trip.rs`. Resolved by P1-T005, because the
   version belongs on the stored record rather than on the document.

Two gaps were found and closed while writing the P1-T007 conformance test, both
invisible until then because only the *enum names* in the schemas were being
compared:

- `RepairContract` serialized its issue as `issue`, and `repair.schema.json`
  requires `issue_id`. The Rust field is now `issue_id`.
- `CheckResult` carried neither `evidence_class` nor `project_fingerprint`, both
  of which `check-result.schema.json` requires.

Both are described in `docs/architecture/PROTOCOL.md`.
