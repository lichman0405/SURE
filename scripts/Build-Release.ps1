# =============================================================================
# What a release artifact is, decided here and recorded in RELEASE_PROCESS.md
# =============================================================================
#
# `docs/development/RELEASE_PROCESS.md` is the only statement in this tree of
# what a release artifact is, and it says three things: a Windows x64
# (`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`) CLI/core archive, a SHA-256 checksum, and a
# PowerShell per-user install/uninstall flow. It does not say the archive
# format, the file naming, or the layout inside. This script decides those, and
# the same decision is written into `docs/development/RELEASE_PROCESS.md` so that
# `P15-T003` (which installs this) and `P15-T004` (which references it) have it
# in a document rather than in a script's source:
#
#   artifact   sure-<version>-<target>.zip
#   checksum   sure-<version>-<target>.zip.sha256, one sha256sum-format line
#   layout     one top-level directory, sure-<version>-<target>/, holding
#              sure.exe, LICENSE and RELEASE.txt
#   location   target/tmp/release/ by default
#
# `target/` is gitignored, so nothing binary is committed. That is the same
# reason `sure_core::release_gate` gives about its own document: it is a
# reading of this checkout on this day, and a committed one would go stale in a
# way nothing reddens.
#
# `-Phase Verify` runs everything that reads the artifact and nothing that
# writes it: it re-reads the `.sha256` file, checks the archive against it,
# extracts, and runs the extracted binary. It exists because "the writer
# checked its own work" and "something else re-read it later" are different
# claims, and only the second survives the writer being wrong.
#
# =============================================================================
# The checksum file is NOT SHA256SUMS.txt, and this is the trap in this task
# =============================================================================
#
# `SHA256SUMS.txt` in the repository root is a frozen, curated integrity
# manifest over a subset of the **source tree**: 195 entries of the form
# `<64-hex>  <repo-relative path>`, no `target/` path, no `sure.exe`, and
# nothing in this repository generates or verifies it. An artifact digest
# placed in it would be a file that looks like assurance and is not, and it
# cannot gain one anyway - the supervisor's `regen-sums.mjs` updates only
# entries that already exist and never adds, removes or reorders one. Its
# ownership, and whether it should exist at all, is `P15-T020`'s question.
# This script never writes it and only ever reads it as a normal tracked file.
#
# =============================================================================
# The release gate, and why this script refuses to package without it
# =============================================================================
#
# `sure_core::release_gate`'s `GATE_CONTRACT` is the repository's own statement
# about packaging, and it is written into the document itself:
#
#   "P15 may build, package or publish a release of this checkout only when
#    this document's `decision` is `permitted`."
#
# This is a P15 packaging task, so the sentence applies to it. It is therefore
# a precondition here and not a report: with no gate document, or with a
# `blocked` one, this script refuses to produce an artifact.
#
# **The cost is real and is named rather than hidden.** A fresh clone cannot
# package until something writes the gate, because the document is a build
# artefact under `target/tmp/` and is produced by
# `cargo test -p sure-core --test acceptance_report_runner`. That test is part
# of `cargo test --workspace`, which CI already runs on every push, so the cost
# falls on a developer who has built but not tested. The alternative - reading
# the decision only when the file happens to be there - is a gate that a
# packaging run can bypass by not having run the tests, which is the shape of
# every false green this repository exists to prevent. A missing gate is
# "cannot confirm", and "cannot confirm" is not a yes.
#
# `P15-T011` (the GitHub release workflow) inherits this decision: its job will
# have to run the acceptance test before it can package.
#
# =============================================================================
# What "builds/tests" means here, and what it deliberately does not
# =============================================================================
#
# `tasks/tasks.json`'s acceptance for `P15-T002` is "x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
# artifact builds/tests and checksum generated", and there are two readings of
# "tests". The one this script establishes is the second:
#
#   the workspace's tests pass  - true, but about a *debug* build. A release
#                                 build has debug_assertions off and different
#                                 codegen, so it is not evidence about the
#                                 bytes in the archive.
#   the artifact is exercised  - this script extracts the archive to a fresh
#                                 directory and runs the executable **from
#                                 there**, by absolute path, with the
#                                 extraction directory it actually used
#                                 asserted against what the binary reports as
#                                 `running_from`.
#
# The property that makes that falsifiable is:
#
#   **the bytes that are checksummed are the bytes that were run.**
#
# It is established by the order of the steps, not by a claim: the digest is
# written, then re-read and checked, and only then is the archive extracted.
# The extracted `sure.exe` is additionally hashed and compared with the one
# cargo built, so a package that silently contained something else reddens.
#
# `cargo test --release` is **not** run by this script. Measured on 2026-09-19
# on the machine this was written on, `cargo test --workspace --all-features
# --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --no-fail-fast` exits 0 with 0
# failed, and that is reported in the task's hand-back rather than implied by
# this script. It is not run here for two reasons: it is minutes rather than
# seconds, and it is not what the acceptance asks for - the acceptance asks
# that the artifact be tested, and the artifact is a binary, not a test
# harness. The two facts are separable and this paragraph keeps them separate.
#
# =============================================================================
# Windows discipline (CLAUDE.md)
# =============================================================================
#
# * Every program is invoked with a typed argument array and the call operator
#   (`& $Program @Arguments`). There is no shell-string construction anywhere in
#   this file, and no assumption of `/bin/sh`.
# * Every claim about a child process - its status, its bytes, its streams -
#   comes from redirection to a **file**. Nothing is read out of a pipeline.
#   `progress/HANDOFF.md` records a Windows capture that produced a wrong number
#   about a child process by taking it from one, and the fix is structural: the
#   exit status is read from `$LASTEXITCODE` on the line after the call and
#   nowhere else, and the text a reader sees is read back from a file with
#   `Get-Content`.
# * No administrator rights, no service, no registry write and no symlink:
#   everything is created under `-OutputDirectory`. Per-user by construction.
# * Paths with spaces and non-ASCII characters go through `Join-Path`,
#   `[IO.Path]::GetFullPath`, `-LiteralPath` and .NET APIs that take a path
#   rather than a glob. This is measured rather than asserted: the whole run is
#   repeated with `-OutputDirectory` at a path containing a space and non-ASCII
#   characters, so that the artifact, the checksum, the extraction directory and
#   the `running_from` the binary reports all carry them. Measured 2026-09-19 -
#   it exits 0 and `running_from` comes back with the non-ASCII characters
#   intact, which is what the `[Console]::OutputEncoding` line above is for.
# * Long paths are tested, and what is tested is a **limit**, not a success. With
#   `-OutputDirectory` nested until the extracted `sure.exe` path is 294
#   characters, the extraction succeeds and the run cannot start: `CreateProcess`
#   is capped at MAX_PATH, and this machine has `LongPathsEnabled = 0`. The
#   script refuses that case by name instead of letting PowerShell's
#   unrelated-sounding message surface - see the guard above the run step.
#
# =============================================================================
# The signature: read rather than asserted (P15-T012)
# =============================================================================
#
# Until `P15-T012` this script wrote a flat heading into the archive's
# `RELEASE.txt` and **never once looked at the file it was talking about**. That
# is a false green of the quietest kind - true on the day it was written, and
# silently false from the moment anybody signs a build - and it was also the one
# platform that behaved that way. `scripts/Build-Release.sh` has had a
# *Signature* step all along: `codesign -d` reads the macOS artifact's signature
# and the reading is printed, and its Linux branch reports `not read` **and gives
# the reason**. Windows asserted. This closes that.
#
# The reading is `Get-AuthenticodeSignature` on the `sure.exe` that is about to
# be zipped, and it has **three** outcomes rather than two, because a reader that
# did not answer is not an observation of absence:
#
#   not-signed       The cmdlet answered `Status` = `NotSigned` with no signer
#                    certificate and no signature type. This is a measurement,
#                    and it is the only state in which `RELEASE.txt` may say the
#                    binary carries no Authenticode signature.
#   signed           A signer certificate or a signature type was read. **The run
#                    fails**, before anything is staged into the archive, and the
#                    failure names every file in this repository that would
#                    otherwise be lying about it. This is `Build-Release.sh`'s
#                    `Authority=` rule, one platform over: an archive whose own
#                    text contradicts its own bytes is the shape this repository
#                    exists to refuse.
#   cannot-confirm   The cmdlet could not be reached, or did not answer in a form
#                    this script can read. It ships in
#                    `Microsoft.PowerShell.Security`, which does not load in a
#                    constrained host, a stripped image, or a session whose
#                    `PSModulePath` cannot find it, so a host exists in which the
#                    question cannot be asked at all. **The run does not fail.** A
#                    missing credential is an *external* limitation, which is the
#                    whole of what `P15-T012`'s acceptance asks to be marked
#                    honestly; a packaging step that refused here would make the
#                    Windows artifact unbuildable on a legitimate machine, and a
#                    check that makes a build impossible is a check somebody
#                    deletes. So the state is written into `RELEASE.txt`, printed,
#                    and repeated in the result block - a stated limitation
#                    beside a successful packaging run, never a pass.
#
# **What is measurable here and what is not.** `There is no Authenticode
# signature on this file` is a fact about bytes, and it is measured on the
# machine that built them. What Windows then *does* with the program - whether a
# given person meets a prompt, in either direction - is a fact about SmartScreen,
# a Microsoft service driven by download telemetry this project does not hold and
# cannot observe. No run here has ever seen the prompt, so this script does not
# get to have an opinion about it: what it can say is that the binary is unsigned
# and that Windows **may** warn. `docs/development/RELEASE_PROCESS.md`'s
# `## Signing` is where that boundary and the list of things that must not be
# written about it are kept.
#
# The reading is taken **twice**, and the second one is why this is a measurement
# rather than a note: once on the staged `sure.exe` before `RELEASE.txt` is
# written, so the sentence in the archive is a function of the reading rather
# than a constant beside it; and once again on the extracted `sure.exe` after
# extraction, in both phases, compared against what `RELEASE.txt` says. That is
# this script's own rule - "the writer checked its own work" and "something else
# re-read it later" are different claims - applied to the signature.
#
# =============================================================================
# Falsifiability - what reddens this script
# =============================================================================
#
# A check that cannot fail is the defect. Four mutations were run against this
# file on 2026-09-19 and each is reproducible from this comment alone.
#
# **Mutation 0 - write the checksum line with `Set-Content`.** In the checksum
# step, replace the `[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText` call with the
# `Set-Content -Encoding ascii` it replaced. Expected and measured: the run
# stops at the first byte assertion with
#
#   FAILED: the checksum file contains a CR at byte 113; sha256sum reads it as
#   part of the file name
#
# and it stops **alone** - `Fail` exits, so the other two assertions never run,
# and they would not have fired if they had: `\r\n` still ends in a newline and
# `-Encoding ascii` writes no BOM. That is the whole reason the CR assertion is
# the one that has to exist, and the blast radius is one check rather than
# three. This is also the mutation that had already happened once for real:
# with `Set-Content`, this script wrote `sure-....zip\r\n`, and the
# `sha256sum.exe` Git for Windows ships answered `FAILED open or read` with
# `'sure-....zip'\r': No such file or directory`, because the CR is part of the
# file name to it. Every Windows tool read that file happily, which is why it
# took an independent verifier to find and why the assertion is on the bytes.
#
# **Mutation 1 - corrupt the artifact after its checksum was written.** Run
# `-Phase All` to completion, then append one byte to the archive without
# touching the `.sha256` file, then run `-Phase Verify`. Expected and measured:
# `Verify` fails at the digest comparison and names the two digests. It does not
# reach the extraction step, which is the point of comparing first.
#
# **Mutation 2 - run whatever `sure` is on `PATH` instead of the extracted
# one.** In the run step below, change `Invoke-Captured`'s `-Program
# $extractedExe` to `-Program 'sure.exe'`, and run the script with the debug
# build's directory prepended to `PATH`. Expected and measured: the `running_from`
# assertion fails, naming the extraction directory it required and the path the
# binary actually reported. This is the subtle one - the run succeeds, the exit
# status is 0, the frame parses, and `target_env` is still `msvc`, because the
# debug build on this machine is also an MSVC build. The assertion on
# `running_from` is the only thing standing between this script and a green run
# that measured a binary nobody shipped; removing that assertion as well makes
# the mutated script pass, which is how the assertion is shown to be the thing
# doing the work rather than the filesystem.
#
# **Mutation 3 - take `logs\` back out of the `Verify` path.** Move the
# `New-Item` that creates `$LogDirectory`, which P15-T002's repair put above the
# phase branch, back inside the `if ($Phase -eq 'All')` branch, which is where
# it was before that repair, and run `-Phase Verify` against a directory holding
# only the archive and its `.sha256`. Expected and measured 2026-09-19: the gate
# passes, the archive matches its checksum, the extraction succeeds, and the run
# then dies inside `Invoke-Captured` with
#
#   FAILED: Could not find a part of the path '...\logs\extracted-doctor.json.txt'.
#
# and exit 1. This is a mutation of a *creation* rather than of a check, and its
# blast radius is that one failure - nothing else can go red, because the
# failure is before the binary is started and the `running_from` comparison is
# never reached. It is a false red rather than a false green: the same archive
# in a directory that has a `logs\` exits 0 and prints OK, and the artifact
# itself is untouched. It is, though, the reading a fresh folder of a downloaded
# artifact is most likely to get, and it arrives *after* the reader has been
# told the checksum is good.
#
# Deleting the line instead of moving it is a *different* mutation with a wider
# blast radius: `-Phase All` redirects into `logs\` in its own first step, so
# that version reddens both phases rather than only `Verify`.
#
# **Mutation 4 - take the reading back out and assert the sentence again.** This
# is the mutation `P15-T012` is about, and it is a mutation of a *check's
# existence* rather than of a check's behaviour, so it is named here with what it
# does and does not do. Delete the `Get-SignatureReading` call and write the
# unsigned paragraph into `RELEASE.txt` unconditionally, as this script did
# before that task: the archive is still produced, the checksum still matches,
# the extracted binary still runs, and every assertion below still agrees,
# because every assertion below is about the *archive* and none of them is about
# whether the sentence inside it was earned. Nothing in this script can notice
# that shape - a script cannot see that a claim it made was never measured.
#
# The guard against it is therefore not here. It is
# `crates/sure-testkit/tests/signing_status.rs`, which reads this file as text
# and fails if the reading leaves it. That test's own header says what that buys
# and what it does not: it proves the mechanism is still written in this file, and
# it cannot prove the branch is taken at run time. What says the branch was taken
# is this script's own output for a real run, which is the evidence `P15-T012`'s
# hand-back carries; it is not a property a test can hold.
#
# A third property - that this cannot pass over a stale extraction - is not
# asserted by a mutation but by construction: the extraction directory is
# deleted before it is written, so a run that does not extract cannot find a
# binary left over from an earlier one.

THIS ARCHIVE IS NOT BYTE-FOR-BYTE REPRODUCIBLE
A ZIP records a timestamp per entry, so building the same commit twice produces
two archives with two different digests. The .sha256 beside this archive is an
integrity check over the bytes that were shipped - that they arrived unchanged -
and it is not a claim that a rebuild would produce them again.

HOW THIS IS CHECKED
This file is written before the checks run, so it describes the procedure
rather than certifying its own archive. scripts/Build-Release.ps1 writes the
.sha256 beside this archive, re-reads it, verifies the archive against it,
extracts the archive to a fresh directory and runs the extracted sure.exe from
there, comparing the running_from the binary reports with that directory. It
prints OK and exits 0 only when every one of those steps agreed, so a run that
failed is a run that said which step failed. See
docs/development/RELEASE_PROCESS.md for how it is meant to be installed
(P15-T003) and referenced (P15-T004).
