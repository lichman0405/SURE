#
# =============================================================================
# Why this file is a shell script and not a second PowerShell script
# =============================================================================
#
# `scripts/Build-Release.ps1` is the Windows artifact's build, and it is
# PowerShell and Windows-only by construction: `ZipFile::CreateFromDirectory`,
# `%LOCALAPPDATA%`, a `sure.exe` and a MAX_PATH guard. `CLAUDE.md` requires the
# Rust core to stay portable to macOS and Linux, and `P15-T005`'s acceptance is
# an aarch64 macOS artifact produced **in CI/release environment**, which means
# on a macOS runner — so the macOS build path cannot be a script that assumes
# Windows, and it cannot be a Windows-only wrapper around one either. A POSIX
# shell script is what runs there: `/bin/sh` on macOS, `sh` on a Linux runner.
# `P15-T007` adds Linux x64 to this script rather than to a sibling one, because
# it is built on the same kind of runner and by the same shape of job as the two
# macOS targets: the version read, the stage, the three files inside the
# archive, the `.sha256` format, the extraction and the run of the extracted
# binary are identical, and two scripts holding the same archive contract are
# two places for it to drift.
# It is written to run under `sh` as well as under `bash` — no arrays, no
# `[[ ]]`, no `mapfile`, no process substitution, no `${var,,}`, and no `${x//y}`
# — because macOS's `/bin/sh` is bash 3.2 in POSIX mode and a Linux runner's
# `/bin/sh` can be `dash`, and a script that needs bash 4 is a script that runs
# on the machine it was written on. The workflow
# invokes it as `sh scripts/Build-Release.sh` rather than by path, for the reason
# `crates/sure-testkit/tests/hook_failure_semantics.rs` gives about the `.sh`
# hook launchers: Git on Windows does not carry the executable bit, so a script
# invoked by path is a script that works on the machine it was written on and
# fails with "Permission denied" on the runner.
#
# =============================================================================
# What a release artifact is, decided here and recorded in RELEASE_PROCESS.md
# =============================================================================
#
# `docs/development/RELEASE_PROCESS.md` states the Windows artifact concretely
# and lists the macOS one as "macOS Apple Silicon CLI archive" with no format,
# no naming and no layout. This script decides those, and the same decision is
# written into that document so a reader has it in a document rather than in a
# script's source:
#
#   artifact   sure-<version>-<target>.tar.gz
#   checksum   sure-<version>-<target>.tar.gz.sha256, one sha256sum-format line
#   layout     one top-level directory, sure-<version>-<target>/, holding
#              sure, LICENSE and RELEASE.txt
#   location   target/tmp/release/ by default
#
# `target/` is gitignored, so nothing binary is committed.
#
# **`tar.gz` rather than `zip`, and the reason is not taste.** A ZIP records a
# file's mode in an "external file attributes" field that is a per-entry
# extension: a writer that does not set it produces an archive whose extracted
# `sure` is not executable, and the extraction is then a file the platform
# refuses to run for a reason that has nothing to do with the build. `tar`
# records the mode as a field of the format, on every writer, and this script
# asserts the extracted file is executable below. The Windows artifact is a ZIP
# because that is what a Windows user expects and what
# `[System.IO.Compression.ZipFile]` writes; the two do not have to match, and
# `P15-T011` (the release workflow) will carry both as what they are.
#
# =============================================================================
# The architecture is established from the artifact, not from the runner
# =============================================================================
#
# **A file named `sure-<version>-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz` is not evidence
# that it holds an ARM binary, and a checksum of it is not evidence that it
# runs.** `macos-latest` is *believed* to be an arm64 image and `ubuntu-latest`
# is *believed* to be x86_64; a belief is not a measurement, and the macOS
# label's meaning has changed before (`macos-13` is Intel, `macos-14` and later
# are Apple Silicon) and will change again. So nothing here reads the runner's
# name:
#
# * the build names its target explicitly — `--target aarch64-apple-darwin` —
#   so the artifact is what the invocation says it is rather than what the host
#   happens to default to, and it would be an arm64 binary even on an Intel
#   runner (Xcode's clang cross-compiles it);
# * the architecture this script *checks* is read from the artifact's own bytes.
#   There are two header families and the check is the family's own:
#
#   Mach-O (the two macOS targets), from the **first eight bytes**: the 4-byte
#   magic and the 4-byte `cputype`. Those are `cf fa ed fe` (64-bit Mach-O,
#   little-endian, the only shape a modern arm64 binary has) and `0c 00 00 01`
#   (`CPU_TYPE_ARM64`) or `07 00 00 01` (`CPU_TYPE_X86_64`).
#
#   ELF (Linux x64), from the **first twenty bytes**: the 4-byte magic
#   `7f 45 4c 46`, `EI_CLASS` at offset 4 and `EI_DATA` at offset 5 — `02 01`
#   is 64-bit little-endian — and `e_machine`, a **2-byte little-endian field
#   at offset 18**, `3e 00` for `EM_X86_64` and `b7 00` for `EM_AARCH64`.
#
#   The bytes read are printed either way, so a reader can check the reading by
#   hand rather than take it on trust;
# * `/usr/bin/file` is asked the same question as a second reader where it
#   exists, its answer is printed, and a disagreement is a failure. It is not
#   the required reader: the header read above is the measurement, and `file`
#   is a second one, so its absence is reported rather than silently tolerated;
# * the runner's own `uname -m` is printed and carried into the log, so a reader
#   can see whether "and it ran" was possible on this machine at all.
#
# =============================================================================
# Why the ELF check reads twenty bytes, and why it is not eight
# =============================================================================
#
# **The Mach-O check's shape cannot be copied to an ELF, and a check built by
# analogy would be a false green.** An ELF's first eight bytes are
# `7f 45 4c 46` (magic), then `EI_CLASS` = `02` (ELFCLASS64), `EI_DATA` = `01`
# (little-endian), `EI_VERSION` = `01` and `EI_OSABI` = `00` (System V) — that
# is `7f454c4602010100`, **and it is identical for an x86_64 ELF and for an
# aarch64 one**. An eight-byte read compared against a fixed expectation would
# therefore accept an arm64 image under `sure-...-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`
# and print that it had checked the architecture, which is the exact failure
# this repository exists to refuse. The field that tells the two apart is
# `e_machine` at offset 18, so the read is twenty bytes.
#
# **And it is not a twenty-byte expectation either.** Offsets 16-17 hold
# `e_type`, which is `03 00` for a PIE (`ET_DYN`) and `02 00` for a non-PIE
# (`ET_EXEC`) — the very two shapes the real bytes this was measured against
# carry, `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`'s own `/bin/ls` being `03 00`. Which of the
# two a build produces is a property of the linker invocation and not a promise
# this repository has ever made, so a fixed twenty-byte prefix would refuse a
# legitimate artifact for a reason that has nothing to do with architecture.
# What is compared is the **discriminating fields** and nothing else: the magic,
# `EI_CLASS`, `EI_DATA` and `e_machine`. The found and required values are both
# printed, so a refusal says which field disagreed.
#
# **What a thin header read does not say.** It does not say the file is a whole
# executable, and it is not treated as if it did: the checksum ties the archive
# to the bytes that were built, and the run step below is what says the bytes
# execute. A universal ("fat") binary is refused rather than accepted, because
# the build asks for one thin architecture and a fat binary appearing here would
# mean that invocation did not do what it says. The ELF reader refuses a
# Mach-O, a PE, a 32-bit ELF and an ELF whose `e_machine` is not the named
# target's, each by name.
#
# =============================================================================
# Where the bytes each row is measured against came from
# =============================================================================
#
# The Mach-O rows are `P15-T005`'s and `P15-T006`'s: the arm64 bytes are the
# ones CI run `35512934506` shipped, the x86_64 bytes are the
# `x86_64-apple-darwin` `std`'s own dylib, and the receiving direction is a real
# universal (fat) binary and a real PE.
#
# **The Linux rows are not the same kind of evidence, and the difference is
# recorded here rather than left for a reader to discover.** There is no aarch64
# ELF on the machine this was written on — no aarch64 linker and none may be
# installed — so:
#
# * the **accepted** row is a real, linker-produced x86_64 ELF: `cp /bin/ls` out
#   of the WSL Ubuntu installation, 11352352 bytes, SHA-256
#   `48893b0fb21436b54619db80486e83ef39dfccaf1aefe83dfa00c02d6146e8c0`,
#   `ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64`. It is an executable rather than
#   this build, which is what a header read is a claim about;
# * the **refused** row of the same width — an aarch64 ELF under an x86_64 name
#   — is **constructed**: the real file above with only its 2-byte `e_machine`
#   at offset 18 changed from `3e 00` to `b7 00`. `file` reads the result as
#   `ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, ARM aarch64`, so the patch is visible to a
#   second reader and not only to this script's own comparison;
# * two further refused rows are **real** ELF images of other machines, found in
#   this machine's Windows driver store rather than invented: Qualcomm's
#   `bdwlan.elf` (`ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM`, `e_machine` `2800`) and its
#   `m3.bin` (`ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel i386`, `e_machine` `0300`).
#   They are refused on `EI_CLASS` as well as on `e_machine`.
#
# So the accepted Linux row is real bytes and the arm64-refusal row is a
# constructed pair of bytes, and neither statement is stronger than that. This
# is what `RELEASE_PROCESS.md`'s Linux section records beside the table.
#
# =============================================================================
# How the version is obtained, and why not by running the artifact
# =============================================================================
#
# `docs/development/RELEASE_PROCESS.md` names the archive after the version
# `sure` itself reports. That value has to be read before the archive is named,
# and the artifact cannot be the thing that reports it: on an Intel runner an
# arm64 binary will not execute, and a packaging step that depends on running
# the artifact is a packaging step that fails on a machine where the artifact is
# perfectly good. So the version comes from `cargo run --bin sure -- --version`
# — a build for **this** host, which can run here — and the shape of that output
# is asserted rather than assumed. `cargo run --bin sure` selects the binary
# named `sure`, which is the same selection `Build-Release.ps1` makes through
# `cargo metadata`, and `crates/sure-cli/tests/cli_contract.rs` holds the two
# spellings of the version to the same number.
#
# =============================================================================
# The release gate, and why this script refuses to package without it
# =============================================================================
#
# `sure_core::release_gate`'s `GATE_CONTRACT` is the repository's own statement
# about packaging: "P15 may build, package or publish a release of this checkout
# only when this document's `decision` is `permitted`." This is a P15 packaging
# task and the sentence is not about Windows, so it is a precondition here too
# and not a report: with no gate document, or with a `blocked` one, this script
# produces no artifact.
#
# The document is written by `cargo test -p sure-core --test acceptance_report_runner`,
# which is part of `cargo test --workspace`. That is what makes the presence of a
# `permitted` gate on a fresh CI checkout evidence that the workspace's tests
# ran **on this runner** rather than merely that someone ran them somewhere:
# `target/` does not exist until the job creates it.
#
# This script reads exactly one field of that document, `decision`. It does not
# reproduce the document's corpus summary the way `Build-Release.ps1` does with
# `ConvertFrom-Json`: this script has no JSON parser, and a hand-rolled reader of
# a nested document is the kind of second implementation that agrees with the
# first one until it does not. The document itself is the place to read the rest
# of it.
#
# =============================================================================
# What "builds/tests" means here, and what it deliberately does not
# =============================================================================
#
# `P15-T005`'s acceptance is "aarch64 macOS artifact builds/tests and checksum
# generated in CI/release environment", and there are two readings of "tests",
# the same two `Build-Release.ps1` separates:
#
#   the workspace's tests pass  - about a *debug* build of the host, and about
#                                 the source tree rather than about the bytes in
#                                 the archive. This script does not run them; the
#                                 workflow does, in its own step, where the log
#                                 says so.
#   the artifact is exercised  - this script extracts the archive to a fresh
#                                 directory and runs `sure doctor` from **there**,
#                                 by absolute path, requiring the binary to
#                                 report `running from` **its own path** — the
#                                 executable the archive was extracted into,
#                                 which is a file inside that directory and not
#                                 the directory itself.
#
# The property that makes the second falsifiable is the one the Windows script
# states: **the bytes that are checksummed are the bytes that were run.** It is
# established by the order of the steps — the digest is written, re-read and
# checked, and only then is the archive extracted — and by a second comparison:
# in `--phase all` the `sure` inside the archive is hashed and compared with the
# one cargo built, so a package that silently contained something else reddens.
#
# =============================================================================
# Falsifiability: what was run on the machine that wrote this, and what was not
# =============================================================================
#
# **No macOS artifact was produced on the machine this was written on, and none
# is claimed.** There is no `aarch64-apple-darwin` `std` installed there and no C
# toolchain for it, so `cargo build --workspace --release --locked --target
# aarch64-apple-darwin` stops with rustc's own `E0463`, "the
# `aarch64-apple-darwin` target may not be installed", and independently with
# cc-rs's `failed to find tool "cc"`; both readings are in the log the script
# names. The run reaches the Build step, prints
# `FAILED: cargo build exited 101`, and exits 1. The half of this file that
# produces an artifact runs on a macOS runner or nowhere.
#
# **`P15-T006` asked the same question of the Intel target and got the same
# answer for a different reason.** `x86_64-apple-darwin` is a value this script
# accepts now, so whether *this* host can produce that artifact was measured
# rather than inherited. The `x86_64-apple-darwin` `std` **is** installed here —
# `rustup target list --installed` lists it — so the run gets past the target's
# own absence and stops at the same C dependency the Linux run below stops at:
# a crate's build script compiles C through `cc-rs`, which needs a compiler for
# the target — here one that emits x86_64 Mach-O objects — and a Windows host
# has none. The crate this log names is `ring v0.17.14`, and it is the crate the
# Linux log below names too; the sentence here used to name `libsqlite3-sys`,
# which neither log mentions: `cargo` stops at `ring`'s build script and never
# compiles `libsqlite3-sys`.
#
#   $ cargo build --workspace --release --locked --target x86_64-apple-darwin
#   cargo:warning=Compiler family detection failed due to error:
#     ToolNotFound: failed to find tool "cc": program not found
#   error occurred in cc-rs: failed to find tool "cc": program not found
#   $ echo $?

#   $ ls target/x86_64-apple-darwin/release/sure

#
# The full log is `target/tmp/p15t006/local-x86_64-apple-darwin-build.txt` on
# the machine that wrote this and is not committed. So neither macOS artifact is
# built on a Windows host, and for the Intel one the missing piece is a C
# toolchain for the target and not the target itself — the same fact
# `docs/development/GITHUB_WORKFLOW.md` records about cross-target `clippy`.
#
# **`P15-T007` asked it of the Linux target and got the same answer again, this
# time with the C compiler's Linux name in it.** Unlike `aarch64-apple-darwin`,
# the `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` `std` **is** installed on that host, so the run
# gets past the target's own absence exactly as the Intel macOS one does:
#
#   $ cargo build --workspace --release --locked --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
#   cargo:warning=Compiler family detection failed due to error: ToolNotFound:
#     failed to find tool "x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc": program not found (see
#     https://docs.rs/cc/latest/cc/#compile-time-requirements for help)
#   error occurred in cc-rs: failed to find tool "x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc":
#     program not found (see https://docs.rs/cc/latest/cc/#compile-time-requirements
#     for help)
#   $ echo $?
#   101
#   $ ls target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/sure
#   ls: cannot access '...': No such file or directory
#
# The full log is `target/tmp/p15t007/local-linux-build.txt` on the machine that
# wrote this and is not committed. So the Linux artifact's build half is not run
# here either, for the reason the Intel macOS one is not: a crate's build script
# compiles C through `cc-rs`, and a Windows host has no compiler that emits ELF
# objects. The crate this log names is `ring v0.17.14` — the same one the Intel
# run above names — and the log is where that name is read rather than supplied
# from here. `cargo` stops at the first crate whose build script fails, so this
# says which dependency failed and not that it is the only one that would.
# **That says nothing about the target** — the same
# build on a Linux runner finds `cc` — and the job that runs it is where the
# artifact comes from.
#
# What *was* run there, so that the unrun half is the only unrun half:
#
# * `sh -n` and `dash -n` both parse the whole file, so it is a script and not a
#   text file that looks like one. `dash` is the point of saying so twice: it is
#   what `/bin/sh` is on the Ubuntu runner, and it is a different shell from the
#   one this file was written on.
# * **The whole check path was then run under `dash` and under `sh`, and the two
#   are identical.** Every `--phase verify` row below was run twice, once with
#   each interpreter, into the same output directories; stdout, stderr, exit
#   status and the failure text are byte-identical between the two runs. So the
#   shell the runner uses is not the shell this *parse* check was taken in, and
#   `printf`, `cut`, `od`, `tar` and `sed` were all exercised there rather than
#   inferred to behave the same. What that still does not establish is the same
#   tools under GNU coreutils on Linux: `dash` was run on this host, against
#   this host's programs.
# * The argument surface: `--help` exits 0, `--phase nonsense` exits 2, and each
#   target refusal exits 2 with its reason named — `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`,
#   which no artifact of this repository is built for, and an unknown triple by
#   name. `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` is no longer among the refusals: it is a
#   value this script builds.
# * The architecture reader, against **real Mach-O bytes** rather than invented
#   ones, in four directions. The installed `x86_64-apple-darwin` `std` supplies
#   a genuine linker-produced Mach-O `sure`; it is refused, with the message
#   naming what was found against what was required. That same binary patched
#   **only** in its 4-byte `cputype` field, `07000001` -> `0c000001`, is
#   accepted, with the eight bytes printed as `cffaedfe0c000001` and `file`'s
#   answer agreeing it is `Mach-O 64-bit arm64`. A real universal ("fat") binary
#   is refused as fat. A real PE is refused as "the Windows artifact shape". So
#   the check is known to refuse three shapes and accept a fourth: it
#   discriminates, and it is not a check that says yes to everything.
# * The architecture reader as a **discriminating** check, in four directions,
#   over archives assembled here from bytes this repository can name. Each row
#   below is one `--phase verify` run; the two middle rows hold bytes of one
#   architecture under the other's name and are the rows that make this a check
#   rather than a spelling:
#
#       archive name          sure's first bytes   Architecture step
#       aarch64-apple-darwin  cffaedfe0c000001     accepted, "Mach-O 64-bit, arm64"
#       x86_64-apple-darwin   cffaedfe07000001     accepted, "Mach-O 64-bit, x86_64"
#       x86_64-apple-darwin   cffaedfe0c000001     refused, "not ... x86_64"
#       aarch64-apple-darwin  cffaedfe07000001     refused, "not ... arm64"
#
#   The arm64 bytes are the real ones `P15-T005`'s CI run shipped, extracted
#   from the archive that run uploaded; the x86_64 bytes are the genuine
#   linker-produced Mach-O named in the target table above. Each refusal prints
#   the bytes it found against the bytes it required, so a reader can see that
#   the two rows differ in the reading and not only in the verdict. Every row
#   exits 1, at the *mode* check and not at this one, for the host reason named
#   below; the Architecture step is read in all four before that happens.
# * The architecture reader's **ELF** half, over real ELF bytes rather than
#   invented ones, with the one row that cannot be real on this machine labelled
#   as constructed. Each row below is one `--phase verify` run, the same shape
#   as the four above:
#
#       archive name                sure's first 20 bytes        step
#       x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu    7f454c4602010100..3e00       accepted, "ELF 64-bit, little-endian, x86_64"
#       x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu    7f454c4602010100..b700       refused, "not ... x86_64"
#       x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu    7f454c4601010161..2800       refused, "ELF 32-bit, little-endian, ARM"
#       x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu    7f454c4601010100..0300       refused, "ELF 32-bit, little-endian, i386"
#       x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu    cffaedfe07000001..           refused, "a Mach-O image"
#       x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu    4d5a9000..                   refused, "a PE image"
#
#   The accepted row is a real one: `/bin/ls` copied out of the WSL Ubuntu
#   installation on this machine, a linker-produced x86_64 ELF, PIE and
#   dynamically linked. Its refusal sibling is that same file with **only** its
#   2-byte `e_machine` field changed, `3e00` -> `b700`, and `file(1)` calls the
#   result `ARM aarch64`. No aarch64 linker exists on that machine and none may
#   be installed, so that row is **constructed**, and it is named as constructed
#   rather than passed off as a real arm64 binary. The ARM32 and i386 rows are
#   **real** objects another vendor shipped (Qualcomm WLAN firmware, and a
#   driver store's `m3.bin`), which is why the two 32-bit refusals are readings
#   rather than spellings. Every row exits 1 at the mode check, for the host
#   reason above, after the Architecture step has printed its reading.
# * The macOS rows, unchanged by this change. All four macOS rows above were run
#   again — through this file as it stood at `HEAD` and as it stands here, into
#   the same output directory so that the printed paths are the same strings —
#   and stdout, stderr and exit status are **byte-identical** for all four
#   (1841, 2201, 1901 and 2195 bytes). `--phase all --target
#   x86_64-apple-darwin` through both files, over the same Mach-O via the
#   stand-in `cargo`, produced two `RELEASE.txt` files of 3540 bytes each that
#   are identical apart from the `built at` timestamp. That is the measurement
#   behind "the macOS text did not move" rather than a reading of the diff:
#   the two family-specific passages below became variables, and a
#   parameterisation that rewrapped the Apple paragraphs would have reproduced
#   the same words in different bytes.
# * The Linux packaging half, end to end, by the same stand-in `cargo`:
#   `--phase all --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` reached the Release gate,
#   the version, the stage, the `RELEASE.txt`, the package, the checksum write
#   (119 bytes, 1 LF, 0 CR), the entry list, the checksum re-read, the
#   extraction and the architecture read, which returned
#   `7f454c4602010100..03003e00` / `ELF 64-bit, little-endian, x86_64` with
#   `file` agreeing, and then stopped at the mode check. As with the Intel row,
#   the stand-in compiles nothing, so this says nothing about whether a real
#   Linux build succeeds; that half belongs to `package-linux`.
# * The arm64 path, unchanged. `--phase verify` over **the artifact CI actually
#   shipped** — `sure-0.0.0-bootstrap-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`, 4065656
#   bytes, SHA-256
#   `3308bb2c12aee7008ed7734565775e96cc092a6c46c1b2efaea87e6d2c820c23`, from run
#   `35512934506` — run through this file as it stood at `6226ce8` and again as
#   it stands here, both into the same output directory so that the paths the
#   run prints are the same strings. Stdout, stderr and exit status are
#   **byte-identical**: 39 lines of stdout, 0 lines of stderr, status 1 both
#   times. The refusal direction was compared the same way (aarch64 name over
#   x86_64 bytes, above) and is byte-identical too. That is the measurement
#   behind "the arm64 path is unchanged" rather than a reading of the diff.
# * The arm64 `RELEASE.txt`, unchanged in its **bytes** and not merely in its
#   words. `--phase all` was run through the file as it stood at `6226ce8` and
#   again as it stands here, both over the same arm64 binary via a stand-in
#   `cargo` on `PATH`, and the two `RELEASE.txt` files out of the two archives
#   are **3490 bytes each and identical apart from the `built at` timestamp**,
#   which differs by construction. That is the measurement, not the argument,
#   behind the newline carried inside `SIGNATURE_LOAD_NOTE` below: a
#   parameterisation that rewrapped that paragraph would have reproduced the
#   same words in different bytes, and this run is what says it did not.
# * The Intel **packaging** path, end to end, by the same stand-in `cargo`:
#   `--phase all --target x86_64-apple-darwin` over the real x86_64 Mach-O bytes
#   reached the Release gate, the version, the stage, the `RELEASE.txt`, the
#   package, the checksum write (114 bytes, 1 LF, 0 CR), the entry list, the
#   checksum re-read, the extraction and the architecture read, which returned
#   `cffaedfe07000001` / `Mach-O 64-bit, x86_64` with `file` agreeing, and then
#   stopped at the mode check for the host reason below. **That is what found the
#   `_` defect named above**: before the pattern was widened, this run failed at
#   the checksum-shape check with a message about the archive's own name. What
#   the stand-in does not do is compile anything, so the stand-in alone says
#   nothing about whether a real Intel build succeeds; that half is measured
#   instead by `35514769749`, whose `package-macos-intel` job ran the real
#   `cargo build --workspace --release --locked --target x86_64-apple-darwin`
#   and exited 0.
#
# **One line the arm64 path does execute was changed, and it is named here
# rather than left in the diff.** The checksum-shape pattern below was
# `[0-9A-Za-z.+-]` as inherited from `P15-T005`, which does not admit `_`; the
# target `x86_64-apple-darwin` contains one, so *every* Intel archive would have
# been refused at that check with a message about its own name. The fixture run
# above is what found it: the Intel row failed there, and only there, before the
# pattern gained the character. The arm64 output cannot differ from the change,
# because `aarch64-apple-darwin` contains no `_` and the new class is a strict
# superset of the old one — and that argument is a claim about a character class
# rather than a reading, which is why the byte-identical comparison above is the
# evidence offered for it.
# * The packaging half, end to end, by `--phase verify` over archives assembled
#   by hand: the entry list against the promised set, the digest recomputed from
#   the bytes on disk and cross-checked with a second tool, the extraction, and
#   the read of the extracted file. `--phase verify` does not build, which is
#   why it is the half that runs on this host whole.
# * The Signature and Run steps, reached by temporarily deleting the mode check
#   below — one mutation, reverted, the file's digest after the revert being the
#   one it had before. `codesign` is absent there, so that step printed that the
#   run says nothing about signing: that is the absent-tool branch working, and
#   it is **not** the `Authority=` branch being tested. The Run step was then
#   reached with a Mach-O this host cannot execute and failed loudly and
#   correctly — exit 126, `cannot execute binary file: Exec format error`, and a
#   message attributing it to the host rather than to the artifact.
# * The `running from` comparison, corrected here, exercised **directly** with
#   planted inputs rather than through the Run step, which this host cannot
#   reach at all: the extracted binary answering passes; a `sure` in another
#   directory, and one with another name in the extraction directory, both
#   fail with the same message shape; and a path reached through a Windows
#   directory junction passes after folding, which is the macOS
#   `/var` -> `/private/var` shape made with a real reparse point. What that
#   reading did not cover *by itself* was the comparison running inside a whole
#   macOS job — and that gap is now closed rather than left open: `35514769749`
#   ran this file end to end on macOS, `package-macos-intel` reaching the
#   extraction and the Run step with the comparison inside it.
#
# What this host cannot exercise at all, named rather than glossed over:
#
# * **The Run step over a correct artifact, here.** That host is MSYS/Cygwin,
#   where `chmod` is a no-op: an extracted `sure` comes out `-rw-r--r--` even
#   from a tar that records 755, so the mode check below fails for a *correct*
#   archive and nothing after it runs without the mutation above. That is a
#   property of the host, and `35514769749` is what says so rather than assuming
#   it: that job's `== Extract` step printed `same as the sure cargo built` on
#   macOS, so the recorded mode does survive packaging and extraction where
#   `chmod` is real, and the local stop was MSYS and not a packaging defect
#   hiding behind it.
# * **Building an arm64 artifact here.** There is no `aarch64-apple-darwin` `std`
#   on that machine, so the header patch `P15-T005` used to reach the accept case
#   is still the only way to *build* one locally. It is no longer the only way to
#   exercise the accept path over genuine arm64 bytes: `P15-T006` ran
#   `--phase verify` over the binary inside the archive `35512934506` uploaded,
#   which Apple's own toolchain linked, and the reader returned
#   `cffaedfe0c000001` / `Mach-O 64-bit, arm64` over it with `file` agreeing.
# * **The `Authority=` failure branch of the Signature step**, which needs a
#   signature chain to refuse and a `codesign` to read one with.
# * **Every step the Linux target runs after the mode check**: the Signature
#   step's *elf* branch, the Run step and the final verdict line. They are
#   unreachable here for the mode reason above, and no Linux artifact exists
#   yet for any other machine to have run them over. `package-linux` is what
#   runs them, and until it has, "the extracted `sure` runs on Linux and says
#   what it is" is unmeasured for this family.
# * **Anything about Gatekeeper**, which nothing in this repository has observed.
#
# What no machine had exercised, and what changed. **The Intel artifact's Run
# step** used to be listed here, and it is no longer a gap of that kind: run
# `35514769749`'s `package-macos-intel` job, `106088732392`, produced
# `sure-0.0.0-bootstrap-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz` on a native Intel host,
# checksummed it, extracted it, and ran the extracted `sure doctor` **from the
# extraction directory**, which exited 0 and ended `the bytes that are
# checksummed are the bytes that were run`. So an Intel Mac can build and run
# what this project produces for it, and the aarch64 artifact is no longer the
# only macOS artifact that exists — there are two. What stays true is narrower
# than the sentences this block used to carry: nothing is published for either
# architecture, the binary is unsigned and unnotarized, and no second build of
# the same commit has been measured.
#
# A comment claiming the whole file is measured would be the defect this
# repository exists to prevent. So: the build half was not run *here* for any of
# the three targets; the check half was; the Run step over a genuine artifact is
# measured on macOS in CI and is still not reachable on this host, and for the
# Linux target no artifact exists on any machine yet; and the `Authority=`
# branch, Gatekeeper and reproducibility remain unmeasured on every machine.

# =============================================================================
# The target, and the facts the artifact has to agree with
# =============================================================================
#
# Three members, for the reason `Build-Release.ps1` gives about its own set: a
# script that accepted any triple would happily produce a file named after a
# platform it never built for. Two are a macOS header family and one is the
# Linux one.
#
# **`P15-T007` added the Linux row, and `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` stopped being
# a refusal.** The value used to reach the `case` below as a named refusal that
# said the Linux artifact was "not a value this script accepts: this script
# reads a Mach-O header, and an ELF has a different one" — which was true of the
# script and is true of the header, and is exactly why the row added here is not
# the macOS row with different constants. `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` is still
# refused, and now for a reason that does not go stale: **no artifact of this
# repository is built for it.** `docs/development/RELEASE_PROCESS.md` lists a
# "Linux x64 CLI archive" and `docs/architecture/RUST_DESIGN.md` names "Linux
# x64"; nothing names an arm64 Linux artifact, no job produces one, and a script
# that accepted the triple would produce a file named for a platform nothing
# here builds.
#
# **The two macOS targets are one code path and one table row apart.** `P15-T006`
# added the second row and changed nothing else: the architecture is read from
# the artifact's own first eight bytes for both, the second reader, the
# extraction, the checksum and the run are the same steps reached the same way,
# and the only values that differ are the four the check compares against. A
# second script for the Intel artifact would have been a second place for those
# reads to drift apart.
#
# **The Linux row is one code path and one table row apart in the same way, and
# the one thing it changes is how many bytes the header read takes.** The
# version read, the stage, the three files inside the archive, the `.sha256`
# format, the entry-list comparison, the extraction, the second reader and the
# run of the extracted binary are the same steps reached the same way. What
# differs is the family: `HEADER_FAMILY` selects the reader, because the two
# families do not merely have different constants — an eight-byte read
# discriminates a Mach-O's architecture and does **not** discriminate an ELF's.
# A sibling script for the Linux artifact would also have been a *third* place
# for the archive contract to drift, and the parts that would have drifted are
# the parts `P15-T005` and `P15-T006` measured.
#
# **`cffaedfe07000001` was confirmed against real bytes before it was written
# here**, because the supervisor's brief said not to trust it and was right not
# to. The real bytes are the `x86_64-apple-darwin` `std`'s own
# `libstd-*.dylib` — shipped by rustup, linked by Apple's own toolchain, and
# therefore a genuine 64-bit little-endian Intel Mach-O rather than a header
# someone typed:
#
#   $ head -c 8 "$HOME/.rustup/toolchains/1.98.1-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/
#       lib/rustlib/x86_64-apple-darwin/lib/libstd-62092c68b9eb1b56.dylib" \
#     | od -An -tx1
#    cf fa ed fe 07 00 00 01
#
# and this host's own `file(1)` calls the same bytes `Mach-O 64-bit x86_64
# dynamically linked shared library`. The file's SHA-256 is
# `1cab997f5855c6ca803cad73478108c207180b91c84247960f7c52c6f243c150`, so the
# reading is over a file anyone can name again. `cf fa ed fe` is `MH_MAGIC_64`
# little-endian and `07 00 00 01` is `CPU_TYPE_X86_64` little-endian; both were
# read off the file rather than recalled.
#
# **`3e00` for the Linux row was read off real bytes the same way**, because a
# header constant taken from memory is the defect this file exists to refuse.
# The file is WSL Ubuntu's own `/bin/ls`, copied out with `cp` rather than piped
# through `cat` — a pipe produced a zero-byte file here, which is the shape of
# evidence that says nothing:
#
#   $ od -An -tx1 -N20 target/tmp/p15t007/bytes/sure-x86_64-real
#    7f 45 4c 46 02 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
#    03 00 3e 00 ...
#   $ file -b target/tmp/p15t007/bytes/sure-x86_64-real
#   ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked,
#   interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, ..., for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, stripped
#
# 11352352 bytes, SHA-256
# `48893b0fb21436b54619db80486e83ef39dfccaf1aefe83dfa00c02d6146e8c0`. Note
# `03 00` at offsets 16-17: that is `e_type` = `ET_DYN`, a PIE, which is why
# `e_type` is one of the fields this check deliberately does **not** compare.
#
# **`EXPECT_ARCH` is not a guess either.** The run step below requires the
# artifact to describe itself as built for `$EXPECT_OS $EXPECT_ARCH`, and those
# two words come from `std::env::consts::OS` and `std::env::consts::ARCH`
# (`crates/sure-core/src/doctor.rs`), which are the `target_os` and
# `target_arch` cfgs of the target the binary was built for. `rustc --print cfg
# --target <T>` prints the strings that will be compiled in:
#
#   x86_64-apple-darwin        target_arch="x86_64"   target_os="macos"
#   aarch64-apple-darwin       target_arch="aarch64"  target_os="macos"
#   x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu   target_arch="x86_64"   target_os="linux"
#
# so `macos x86_64` and `linux x86_64` are measurements of the targets rather
# than spellings chosen here. Note that `file(1)`'s word for the same cputype is
# different again (`arm64`, not `aarch64`; `x86-64` with a hyphen, not `x86_64`),
# which is why the second reader has its own value rather than being compared
# against `EXPECT_ARCH`.

# `sha256sum` is not part of a macOS base install — it arrives with GNU
# coreutils — and `shasum` is, so the tool is discovered rather than assumed.

# Y" is a number with nothing behind it.
#
# The extraction takes everything before the first space of the tool's first
# line: `sha256sum` writes `<hex>  <name>` for a text-mode read and
# `<hex> *<name>` for a binary-mode one, and **which of the two it writes is the
# platform's, not this script's** — on Git for Windows all three tools below
# print the `*` form, measured here, because MSYS opens files in binary mode.
# `openssl dgst -sha256 -r` writes `<hex> *<name>` everywhere. Only the hex is
# taken from these lines, so the separator is not part of any decision.
#
# The value is then required to be exactly 64 lowercase hex characters, so a
# tool that printed something else fails the check rather than producing a
# `.sha256` file holding the wrong shape.

Neither is an oversight: docs/development/RELEASE_PROCESS.md records Developer
ID signing and notarization as an external credential this project does not
have, and says \"Do not fake signing\". No step of this build applies one. What
that means is a fact about the build procedure and not a claim about the bytes,
and the bytes are read: scripts/Build-Release.sh runs \"codesign -d\" on the
extracted binary and prints everything it says. A signing *chain* there - an
Authority= line, which is what a certificate produces - fails the run, because
this file says there is none.

An $EXPECT_FILE_ARCH binary can carry an ad-hoc signature, $SIGNATURE_LOAD_NOTE. That is not a certificate, it names no
developer, and it does not contradict the paragraph above; if the reading says
\`Signature=adhoc\` that is what it is.

What macOS does with a program that carries no Developer ID signature is
Apple's behaviour and not SURE's, and this project has not observed it on a Mac
- the general shape is that Gatekeeper refuses or warns about one whose
com.apple.quarantine attribute is set, which is what a browser download sets
and what a command-line download may not. Nothing in SURE asks you to turn
Gatekeeper off. If a prompt appears, treat it as the unsigned state above and
decide for yourself; do not read this file as saying the build is trusted."

            RELEASE_SIGNATURE_SECTION="THIS BUILD CARRIES NO SIGNATURE AND NO STEP OF THIS BUILD APPLIES ONE
Neither is an oversight: docs/development/RELEASE_PROCESS.md records code
signing as an external credential this project does not have, and says \"Do not
fake signing\". That sentence is deliberately a fact about the build procedure
and not a claim about the bytes, and unlike the macOS build there is no reading
that would turn it into one: Linux has no \`codesign\`, and a signature over an
ELF is a detached file beside it or a digest in a distribution packager's
database, never a field inside the image. So there is nothing in
$ARTIFACT_NAME.tar.gz to read a certificate out of. The entries of the archive
are listed and checked against the promised set before it is written, and
they are three files. The .sha256 beside the archive is an integrity digest,
not a signature: it says the bytes arrived unchanged and says nothing about
who wrote them.

WHAT THIS BINARY NEEDS FROM THE MACHINE IT RUNS ON
This is built for the x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu target, which links the GNU C
library (glibc) of the machine it was built on rather than a static C library,
so it needs a glibc at least as new as the symbols it asks for, and it does not
run on a musl distribution such as Alpine or against an older loader. It is
linked dynamically, not statically: the interpreter path it records (normally
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2) is the loader the machine has to provide. The
oldest distribution it runs on is set by the glibc of the machine it was built
on, and this file does not name it: the binary carries the answer itself, as
GLIBC_x.yy lines among its undefined symbols, which \"objdump -p\" on the
extracted \`sure\` prints, and \"ldd --version\" on your machine prints what your
machine has. Nothing here patches or bundles a C library, and no step of this
build uses patchelf or similar: what the linker produced is what is inside the
archive."

$RELEASE_SIGNATURE_SECTION

THIS ARCHIVE IS NOT BYTE-FOR-BYTE REPRODUCIBLE
A gzip stream records a modification time in its header and a tar records one
per entry, so building the same commit twice produces two archives with two
different digests. The .sha256 beside this archive is an integrity check over
the bytes that were shipped - that they arrived unchanged - and it is not a
claim that a rebuild would produce them again.

HOW THIS IS CHECKED
This file is written before the checks run, so it describes the procedure
rather than certifying its own archive. scripts/Build-Release.sh writes the
.sha256 beside this archive, re-reads it, verifies the archive against it,
lists the archive's entries and requires them to be the promised set, extracts
the archive to a fresh directory, $RELEASE_HEADER_READING, and runs the extracted "sure" from there,
comparing the running_from it reports with that directory. It prints OK and
exits 0 only when every one of those steps agreed, so a run that failed is a
run that said which step failed.
See docs/development/RELEASE_PROCESS.md for the artifact contract.

# For the macOS family, the RELEASE.txt inside this archive says the build

# evidence about that file. This is the reading behind the sentence: `codesign
# -d` is macOS's own question, its answer is printed in full whatever it is, and
# the failure is on the one direction that matters — a signature **chain**, which
# is what a certificate produces, arriving in an archive whose own text says
# there is none.
#
# **An arm64 binary is expected to carry an ad-hoc signature**, and that is not
# a certificate: it is what the toolchain applies so the kernel will load the
# image, it names no developer, and its presence does not contradict the
# sentence. So the failure is keyed on an `Authority=` line, which an ad-hoc
# signature does not produce and a Developer ID chain does, and **not** on the
# exit status — `codesign -d` exits 0 for an ad-hoc signature and 1 for none at
# all. Keying it on the exit status would have failed every correct artifact.
#
# A `codesign` that is missing, or that cannot read the file, leaves the reading
# unknown; unknown is reported as unknown rather than turned into "unsigned".
# **Notarization is not read here at all**: nothing in this build notarizes, so
# the sentence rests on there being no such step, not on this measurement.
#
# The ELF family has no equivalent question to ask — see the branch below, which
# reports that as not-read rather than printing a line that sounds like a
# measurement. The RELEASE.txt paragraph for that family is written to rest on
# there being no signing step, which is what can be established here.
