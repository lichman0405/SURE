#
# =============================================================================
# The directory this removes from also holds the user's evidence
# =============================================================================
#
# `scripts/Install-Sure.ps1` installs into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SURE\bin` because
# eight launcher scripts in this tree already resolve
# `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SURE\bin\sure.exe`.
# `crates/sure-core/src/paths/mod.rs` puts the user's durable evidence — `sure.db`,
# the history a verdict is read from — at `<per-user data>\SURE`, which on Windows
# is **the same directory**. So the normal state of that directory is:
#
#     %LOCALAPPDATA%\SURE\
#         bin\sure.exe     what the install wrote
#         sure.db          the user's evidence, which the install did not write
#
# An uninstaller that removed that directory would destroy the record SURE exists
# to keep, and it would do it in the name of tidying up. This one is built so
# that it *cannot*:
#
#   1. **There is no recursive delete in this file.** Not of the install root,
#      not of `bin\`, not of anything. A directory is removed only when it is
#      already empty, so a directory holding a file this install did not write
#      cannot be removed at all — the filesystem refuses, not this script's
#      judgement. `crates/sure-cli/tests/install_flow.rs` reads this file and
#      fails if the word `-Recurse` appears in it.
#   2. **A file is removed only if the install's own manifest records it *and*
#      its digest is still the digest the install wrote.** The manifest is the
#      answer to "how does it know which files it created": the installer writes
#      it, and nothing else in this repository writes one. A file whose bytes
#      changed since — a newer binary, a file the user replaced — is not what
#      this install wrote, so it is reported and left.
#   3. **`sure.db` is not in the manifest**, because the install never writes it.
#      It is therefore unreachable from the removal above, whatever it contains.
#      The only code path that can remove it is `-RemoveUserData`, which names it
#      individually and which defaults to off.
#   4. **With no manifest, it removes nothing at all.** "What did this install
#      create?" has no answer in that state, and a guessed answer is the defect.
#      It says what it found, leaves it, and exits 2 — `Cannot confirm` is a
#      result, and it is not a yes.
#
# =============================================================================
# The choice about user data, and what it is a choice between
# =============================================================================
#
#   (default)          the program is removed; the user's history is kept, is
#                      named in the output, and the one switch that removes it
#                      is named with it.
#   -RemoveUserData    the store and SQLite's two sidecars for it are removed as
#                      well — `sure.db`, `sure.db-wal`, `sure.db-shm` — by name,
#                      inside the install root only. Nothing else in the
#                      directory is touched, however it is named.
#
# The names are `crates/sure-core/src/paths/mod.rs`'s `STORE_FILE` plus the two
# files SQLite's WAL journal mode creates beside it. They are *checkable* rather
# than copied on faith: `crates/sure-cli/tests/install_flow.rs` reads the list
# below and fails if it stops matching that constant.
#
# The user-level settings file (`%APPDATA%\SURE\sure.yaml`, the *config*
# directory) is outside the install root. This script never removes a file
# outside the install root, so it names that file and leaves it; a person who
# wants it gone removes one file they can see the name of.
#
# =============================================================================
# What this deliberately does not do
# =============================================================================
#
# No directory walk, no registry key, no service, no scheduled task, no `PATH`
# edit by this script, and no administrator rights. Nothing was added to those
# places by the install and nothing is removed from them here. `-WhatIf` prints
# every removal it would make and makes none.
